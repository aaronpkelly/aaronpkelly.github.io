- watched [Clean Code - Uncle Bob / Lesson 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjywrq2gM8o) and started on the next one
	- all my clean code learnings will be added to my various markdown notes as always
- watched [Let's port Diablo to SerenityOS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOzZ8R4gphE) and I really enjoyed it, Andreas Kling is really great to watch
	- he actually reminds me of [Bisqwit](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bisqwit)
