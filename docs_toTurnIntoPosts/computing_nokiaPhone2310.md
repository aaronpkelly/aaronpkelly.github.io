I requested a network unlock code from vodafone via nac.vodafone.ie on Aug 31,
they gave me no email confirmation, only text on their website which read:
"Your request has been sent

number you entered with the code within 7 to 11 working days.
If you are not eligible we will contact you to advise of next steps"
