Baking soda - weak alkaline, good for cutting through grease and absorbing odours
Vinegar - weak acid, good for dissolving residue, also a natural germicide

Baking soda + vinegar - Good cleaning abrasive, because salt is abrasive (acid + base = salt + water)

3 part baking soda 1 part water - A good scourer paste for tough stains
