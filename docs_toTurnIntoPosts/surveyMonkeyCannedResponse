Since 2003 I've been in involved almost exclusively in the customer service industry.

I started with providing face-to-face customer service while working at an internet café in a busy city centre location in Dublin. 

I then moved on to Hewlett Packard where I was responsible for providing technical support over the phone for traders that worked in Credit Suisse. We needed to be professional, accurate and respond to issues quickly.

In my current role in Arvato Finance, I need to provide email, phone and respond to tickets from users in all our global locations. We also have a large portfolio of clients that can raise issues with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - so we need to be ready to respond to them.

In all three positions a strong focus was made on providing excellent customer service, and it's a quality that I adhere to in any role I am employed in.
