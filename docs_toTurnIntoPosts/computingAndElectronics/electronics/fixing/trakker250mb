ftape driver
============
no longer available from usual sources, i did find one on sourceforge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ftape/

building
========
having problems building the ftape driver due to kernel files not being 
available on mint that it expects to use during the build process.

i've tried downloading a kernel from kernel.org but i don't think that's 
sufficient, i think the files it needs need to be from an installed system.

this message says that this directory on modern linux systems should hold the
needed files, but I don't think it works:

	Nowadays, most distributions provide the correctly configured kernels
	now, there's a symlink /lib/modules/<version>/build. If that is not
	the case the bestt way is to compile kernel and all modules yourself.
	There is also a configure option to compile both kernel and modules
	without the version tags.
