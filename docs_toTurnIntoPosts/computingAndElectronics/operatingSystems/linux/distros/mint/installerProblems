# UEFI / non-UEFI
i install my os's in non-UEFI mode. this means the MBR must be overwritten on the device by grub

# installing bootloader
install the bootloader to the device file (dev/sda), and not a partition.
because the system is non-UEFI, the MBR must be overwritten with the location of the grub image.
if the system *was* UEFI, I believe a 1MB partition at the start of the disk is used to put the
location of the bootloader.

# create an empty partition for the bootloader image
create a ~500MB /boot partition to hold the grub image

# process in charge of installation window
