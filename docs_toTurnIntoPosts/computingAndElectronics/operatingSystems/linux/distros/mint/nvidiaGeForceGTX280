probrems?
========
add `nomodeset` to the kernel options to run in software rendering mode

proprietary nvida drivers
=========================
on distros such as mint, the drivers that are most compatible with all games,
such as dota2, are in the legacy nvidia-34x download from their
website. i think it's best to not use the package manager's installer
try the package nvidia-340 from their website. 

disabling x
-----------
mint: 
	`sudo service mdm stop`

the installer should run now

## blinking cursor on all tty after disabling x
execute this command:
	
	mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak

then try shutting down the x server from within x itself.
that will force X to regenerate a new config file, and hopefully resolve
the blinking cursor issue

disabling noveau
----------------
the nvidia installer will offer to add a config file to the
modprobe.d/ directory in order to disable the kernel's noveau
driver. let it do this, and then run

	`sudo update-initramfs -u`

then reboot!

libc6-dev
=========
the installation may complain that the libc header files are missing. just
install the *libc6-dev* package

the below is potentially wrong
==============================
update: i have run into a problem with this (i think). Systems with nVidia
adapters using the nouveau driver lock up randomly, so even though its 
been disabled by the nvidia installer, it looks like its still trying to
access it. I will try adding the boot option `nouveau.noaccel=1`. Then I'll
try blacklisting the nouveau driver using a command like:
`sudo echo nouveau >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`.

I'll report back if it works!
