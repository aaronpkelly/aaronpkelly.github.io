# xorg gon' give it to ya

# which package to install
install the lightweight `xorg` server, not the bigger x11 package

# jessfraz's .x* files kinda fuck things up
just remove all symbolic links except .xinitrc and .Xprofile.
shit's whack yo

# drivers drivers drivers - keep it simple, use onboard graphics
just start getting x working with our onboard graphics before you
try and get it working with your grpahics card.

install these packages:
- x11-base/xorg-drivers
- media-libs/mesa
- xf86-video-{evdev, vesa} # 2 packages
# - xf86-video-fbdev # not sure if needed
# - xf86-video-intel # should be built in to x11-base/xorg-server

# edit /etc/portage/make.conf
for most basic onboard intel graphics, add `VIDEO_CARDS="intel i915"`

# run this after changing make.conf
`emerge --ask --changed-use --deep @world`

# you don't need an xorg.conf file
x is pretty good at autodetecting which drivers to use. dont make one
for the moment

# create a ~/.xinitrc file to start default programs, or a window manager
for testing, put this in the config required to start (requires xterm)

```
!#/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/xterm
```

if that works, then you know your x is working!

# install a window manager and edit ~/.xinitrc
i3, cinammon..

then change the line in `~/.xinitrc` to:
`exec i3`

# start!
`startx` to start xorg
