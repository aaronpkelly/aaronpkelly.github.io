# dell xps 13 - dual booting
## settings
in the BIOS, turn all features off:
- disable secureboot
- disable AHCI
- disable sata controllers

turn all these features on:
UEFI

you want to install linux + windows under the simplest conditions possible.
DO NOT enable legacy boot mode for the moment.

## overview of installation flow:
- write linux image to usb
- write windows image to usb using windows media creation tool
- write windows network driver to usb - go to dell xps 13 9360 website and copy driver for killer 1535 adapter
- set BIOS settings to simplest possible
- install linux mint FIRST
- use linux mint usb to resize linux partition
- install windows SECOND. windows will install its bootloader after linux
- check both OS's are booting ok
- install wifi driver on windows

## usb writing tips
any problems with linux mint installation is MOST LIKELY due to how it was copied.
error messages like `Input/Output error when writing to hard disk` is probably a bad
installation medium (yes, it happened).

success has been found in the following ways:
- write linux mint image using `dd` under linux or *Rufus* under windows
- if using Rufus, using DD write mode

# general
## wifi problems - getting around them
use the bluetooth connection on a phone to get internet access to download
whatever files you need. you don't need to mess with usb keys/cables.

# linux
## installation problems
### can't find disk drive
linux can sometimes struggle to see a disk drive if the BIOS instructs the
SATA disk controller to function in RAID mode. change the SATA mode to ACHI so
linux can see it

## kernel switches
if installing a distribution with no graphical interface, use kernel switches
to tell grub to load no video drivers from the kernel! Eg:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet nomodeset"

don't forget update-grub....

# windows
usb boot problems
-----------------
there is an app called 'Rufus' (rufus.akeo.ie) that seems to do a really good
job of making bootable usbs for windows - it worked where *dd* did not.

dvd boot problems
----------------
burning an .iso on the *slowest speed possible* has been suggested as a
resolution to non-booting windows DVDs
