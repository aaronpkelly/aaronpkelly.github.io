# Overview
This file is intended to be reread after long stints of non-playing, to remind
myself of best practices and keybinds!

# Keybinds
Be consistent with keybinds across every character.
The point of this bindings is that no matter what character you can play, similar
abilities will always be located in the same places.

# Macros
Most of my macros will already be available in-game.
Keep the amount of character-specific macros to a minimum, make them general.
I'm going to include two of my most used macros:
## Sell greys
## Mouseover macro
use this mouseover macro for healing specs on all ur spells, works
with raid frames:
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Holy Shock

# General tips
- All instant/combat-related/heavy-use abilities go on the main actionbar.
The only exception is the mouseup/mousedown keybind on the bottom-right
actionbar, which is used for the most used instants for your class.
- The bottom-left actionbar is used for class buffs, long cooldowns and
defensive cooldowns
- Some esoteric/longer duration spells may not be keybound for simplicity - just
cast them manually.
## PVP
- Do not play with combat addons - everything you want can be done with macros
and LUA scripting
- Unlock unit frames and position your frame just below left of your avatar, the
target to the below right of your avatar, and your focus target to the upper
left

# List of status effects
## CC effects
root, slow, stun, mesmerize, fear, horror, silence, disarm, knockback, ...
## Status effects
todo...

# Role notes
## Healer
Heal using your most efficient spells possible. Don't overheal. Aim to do
very little world healing the group... :)

# Class notes
## Disc priest:
- heal + flash heal should never be used. You should be preventing
damage and healing through atonement (dealing damage). Put them on ur
actionbar as a last resort tho
