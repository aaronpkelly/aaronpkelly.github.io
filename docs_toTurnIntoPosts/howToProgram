# this stays at the top - KEEP IT SIMPLE
use midnight commander, type `select-editor` to select vim, and program as
much as you can in this environment.

bind a function key to execute your program, e.g. `F9`

# lintcode / leetcode for algorithm examples
these websites are rich in examples of classical algorithms

# patterns - why read 100 books
why read 100 books on 100 languages, when you can just learn programming
patterns and apply them to *any* language you are learning. focus on finding
the patterns behind everything and learning them
# report generation - write STDOUT to a markdown compatible file
don't spend ages pulling out results from your program after its run. write
all the relevant STDOUT to a file, and make sure what's written is in 
*markdown format*.

not only do you build great looking reports every time you run your program,
you can also generate markdown code that builds constructs like html tables
very easily.

doing all of this also has the happy benefit of making your program generate
clean and sensible output, as it will appear in a report.

# write pseudocode
It's amazingly powerful for keeping your mind focussed on whatever algorithm
or task you are tackling
