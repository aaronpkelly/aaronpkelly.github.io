THE RULES!
Split yourselves as evenly as possible into 3 teams. Each team must pick a name out of a hat (Johnny, Mark & Lisa) Congratulations, you've just selected your team character. Each team has their own set of tasks to carry out throughout the movie. To make things more interesting, there is also a set of tasks ALL PLAYERS must participate in throughout the movie. Let's get to it shall we? But remember, don't plan too much, it may not come out right.

TEAM JOHNNY
OH HAI!- Self explanatory- whenever you hear this greeting, Drink 2
HAHAHA!- Every time Johnny laughs, Drink 1
EVERYBODY BETRAY ME!- Whenever Johnny talks betrayal, Drink 2
CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP!- Johnny makes a chicken noise, join in. Then shot.
TOMMY'S DEAD!- Denny can't even get your name right. Finish vessel.

TEAM MARK
CAPTAIN OBLIVIOUS- Every time Mark asks Lisa "What's going on?" or "What are you doing?" Drink 2
BEST FRIENDS- But Johnny's your best friend!!! Whenever this friendship is referred to by any character, Drink 1
"LEAVE YOUR STUPID COMMENTS IN YOUR POCKET!"- It's a stressful moment for your character. Finish vessel.
YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH LISA, AREN'T YOU?- During your rooftop scene with Peter, whenever Lisa's name is mentioned take a drink. Also share a joint or bong with your teammates throughout the whole scene (optional) If you're not into that, line up the shots. Or just kill yourself. Something crazy ike that.
YOU LOOK LIKE A BABYFACE- Your face is so smooth. Shot.

TEAM LISA
FEMME FATALE- Whenever your attactiveness, sexiness, beauty is referred to, Drink 2
SEX SCENE- Whenever you're naked/topless on screen, Drink 2
LIES!- Whenever you lie to or about Johnny, finish vessel
WINE!!!!- Look carefully at your wine glass in your scene with Michelle, whenever the continuity is out (and it is... a lot) Drink 1
"YOU OWE ME ONE"- Whenever you say this, take a shot.
"I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT."- Whenever you say this, Drink 1. (this rule submitted by Stephen Cook :D)

ALL PLAYERS/2 TEAM CHALLENGES

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT- Whenever this is said, all players Drink 1
"I GOT THE RESULTS OF THE TEST BACK, I DEFINITELY HAVE BREAST CANCER"- All players take a shot.
SCOTCHKA- All players must have a scotchka with Johnny & Lisa
"I'M TAAAAAIRED, I'M WAAASTTED, AH LUUUVE YOU DAHLING.'- When Johnny slurs these immortal words, all players must contribute to the vessel. Keep it varied, we want a nice mix of beer & various liquors. That's all for now, you'll be needing this shortly.
"CHOCOLATE IS A SYMBOL OF LOVE"- When Mike shares this insightful factoid with us, it's time for a good, old fashioned speed eating contest. All players must eat their chocolate bar as quickly as possible. Last person to finish must down the vessel you all just filled. 
WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY, DENNY?!?!?!- Whenever the words 'money' or 'drugs' are said in this scene, all players take 1 drink
"YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!"- Team Mark gets to sit this one out. Team Johnny gets to make each member of Team Lisa remove ONE item of clothing. As an added bonus, Team Johnny gets to choose which items of clothing come off. Any member of Team Lisa may opt out, but the penalty is to down a full vessel.
CAUGHT IN A RAD BROMANCE- During J & M's bromance montage, all male team members of Team Mark & Team Johnny must make out with each other. Team Lisa may award penalties to players who refuse to do so, or don't get into the spirit of the challenge enough. If there are no males playing, or a lesser number of males on one team, then the girls might have to get involved too. Alternatively, Team Lisa may elect one person from each team to "take one for the team" so to speak.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JOHNNY- When Happy Birthday is sung, all players must waterfall for the duration of the song
OH HAI, STEVEN!- Who the hell is this guy? Every time Steven has a line of dialogue, all players Drink 1
"I FEEL LIKE I'M SITTING ON AN ATOMIC BOMB WAITING FOR IT TO GO OFF!"- When Steven says this, instead of taking 1 drink (as above) all players take a shot
GOD, FORGIVE ME- When Johnny commits suicide, all players celebrate by downing a full vessel.
Food
Aaron - Chocolate chip oatcakes (TBA) Probably brownies as dessert or something else tasty!
Mark - Potato salad (he better come through on this!) if not we beat him!
 <- This will not happen as potato salad will surely come
