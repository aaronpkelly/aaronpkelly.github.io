## web - secure file sending programs

https://webwormhole.io/ (Send files from one computer to another, this project started as a UI for magic-wormhole, but drifted away when I wanted to experiment with the PAKE used, the
protocol, and the word lists, source: https://github.com/saljam/webwormhole)

https://wormhole.app/ (P2P, secure, unrelated to magic-wormhole, wormhole.app is an independent design and implementation,  source code: https://github.com/SocketDev/wormhole-crypto)

https://file.pizza (P2P, E2E, webtorrent, needs to load entire file before it starts serving it)

https://instant.io (P2P)

https://onionshare.org/ (P2P, secure, TOR)

https://www.sharedrop.io (P2P)
