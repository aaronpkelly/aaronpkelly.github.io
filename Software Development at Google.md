First I saw this: https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/ex-googler-guide-dev-tools/

Which led me to this book: https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791

I then found this: https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg

There's also a paper - maybe it's where it all started?: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.01715.pdf
