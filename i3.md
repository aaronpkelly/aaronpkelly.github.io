# configuration
you can use the `i3-config-wizard` to generate a default configuration file at `~/.config/i3/config`

The default is pretty good, however it has bindings for [[Pulseaudio]] by default, I prefer [[alsa]]

i save my config file to my dotfiles git repo

## volume control
use https://github.com/hastinbe/i3-volume

follow [these instructions]( https://github.com/hastinbe/i3-volume/wiki/Installation#i3wm) - make sure you clone to `~/i3-volume` as that's the location the script looks for

if using [nixos](nixos.md), you may need to change the interpreter at the top of that script:

```
$ head ~/i3-volume/volume
- #!/bin/bash
+ #!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash
```

open `alsamixer` and then start using your volume control buttons, you should see the volume display increase/decrease
