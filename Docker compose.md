This is an [incredible tool](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) that greatly simplifies the process of working with containers. No longer do you have to remember som arcane serious of `docker run` commands, you can just define exactly how you want your docker containers to behave, how environment variables are set, how volumes are mapped... and put it all in one file.
