A strange idea for a hack-and-slack diablo-type game:
- you can wound enemies but not kill them
- if you kill them, you need to be careful about which enemies you slay
	- killing enemies with certain traits decreases that trait in the world, but increases others
	- the enemy's family (?) that is killed seeks vengeance, and will increase in hatred and strength
- slaying enemies selectively and carefully will weaken the world for the better
- slaying enemies recklessly will strengthen your foes
