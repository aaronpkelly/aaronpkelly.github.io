From [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html):

> Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
