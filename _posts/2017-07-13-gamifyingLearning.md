title: Can I game productively? The question of the ages
---

For me, college finished in May 2017. During my four years, I had a lot of time
to try different learning methods and experiment with what worked for me.

A big struggle I had was the need to satisfy my urge to play games - which lead
me to think about gamifying learning, and a question:

"Can I game productively?"

I am lucky in that I enjoy all game genres. In order to scratch my itch, a game
could take the form of a:
- simple text based quiz
- a web-based html/css/javascript text+image game

to talk about:
- managing time
- games that teach (hacking games/edumacational?)
- creating my own games and in doing so, learning a whole lot of skills along
the way
