title: Can I game productively? The question of the ages
---

For me, college finished in May 2017. During my four years, I had a lot of time
to try different learning methods and experiment with what worked for me.

A big struggle I had was the need to satisfy my urge to play games - which lead
me to think about gamifying learning, and a question:

*"Can I game productively?"*

Game formats don't have to be in a complex third-person shooter form, they
could take the form of a:
- simple text based quiz
- a web-based html/css/javascript text+image game
