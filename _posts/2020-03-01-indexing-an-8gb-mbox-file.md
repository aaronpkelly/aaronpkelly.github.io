# Indexing an 8GB MBOX file

This is a post series on how I exported, converted, and made searchable a
gigantic mailbox, containing ~15 years worth of email and attachments.

To do this, I make use of a number of techniques in the following posts. I've placed them in a logical order here, but they can also be read individually:

[Exfiltrating data from Cloud Services]({% post_url 2020-03-02-exfiltrating-data-from-cloud-services %})

[Journey to the Center of the MBOX]({% post_url 2020-03-03-journey-to-the-center-of-the-mbox %})

[Sorting and Formatting the MBOX output]({% post_url 2020-03-04-sorting-and-formatting-the-mbox-output %})

[Preparing text files for indexing]({% post_url 2020-03-05-preparing-text-files-for-indexing  %})

[Searching for an Indexing Tool]({% post_url 2020-03-06-searching-for-an-indexing-tool %})
