## Caribou
Great music, and his profile text on spotify is really inspiring:

	Hi, it's Dan. Do you make music too? I always dreamed of being a musician. When I was starting out I had access to super basic equipment and don't claim any special insight into music - just enthusiasm. If I did it, you can too. Send me your music on social media. Have fun and enjoy yourself. Bye!
