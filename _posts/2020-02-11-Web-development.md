# Web development
- learn plain JS



## Keep in mind

- frameworks come and go - but vanilla javascript is here to stay!

Zero-cost hosting:
- the best website is a static website 
- netlify is free ([[Jamstack]] anyone?), public domain address
- AWS S3 buckets can serve static websites, public domain address
- all of the above can still use JS + call APIs etc
- all of the above can use [[Cloudflare]] as a free CDN to sit in front of your site and reduce the cost from pennies to zero
