# install Raspberry Pi OS


## Raspberry Pi Imager

Use the `Raspberry Pi Imager` tool if you can:
- it give you a lot of different types of OS's to install
- it can configure your SSH and WIFI credentials during the install
- before selecting an OS, check which OSs are compatible with the various Pis: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/
	- be careful if you're using a Pi Zero W, as the 64-bit **_Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)_** is not compatible with it!

plug in your sd card reader, you should see empty mount points appear:

	$ lsblk
	sda                   8:0    1     0B  0 disk
	sdb                   8:16   1     0B  0 disk
	sdc                   8:32   1     0B  0 disk
	sdd                   8:48   1     0B  0 disk

As soon as you insert your SD card, you should immediately see the storage appear under one of these mount points:

	$ lsblk
	...
	sda                 8:0    1  29.7G  0 disk
	├─sda1              8:1    1  42.9M  0 part
	└─sda2              8:2    1  29.7G  0 part

You should now be able to run the `Raspberry Pi Imager`

NixOS has the `rpi-imager` tool available, so you don't have to download anything:

	nix-shell -p rpi-imager

But currently I'm having a hard time using this tool on NixOS because that tool needs super access, and as soon as it's run with `sudo`, it crashes

# browser
I had to edit /etc/resolv.conf because of slow loading times, I appended the
following to the file:

```
# my options
options timeout:1 attempts:5
```

# go
I had to build go from source, as the version of go that comes with the
raspian distro is not compatible with megacmd

# scanner
problems with sane and detecting a USB scanner

i had to go to /dev/bus and
```
chmod -R 777 usb
```
after that the scanner was detected by scanimage -L

# sound
ALSA should already be pre-installed, use that - not pulseaudio.

[[MPlayer]] will use the default libavcodec to play mp3 files - which is fine. It
will complain however that it can't find the mpg123 codec files to play.
Install the packages libmpg123-0 (and maybe mpg123?) and then edit the 
~/.mplayer/config file to include:
```
afm=mp3lib
```

The pi can either output audio via the hdmi cable or the standard analogue 
audio jack. Use the below command to switch between hdmi/analogue:

Substituting <n> for the desired mode: 0=auto, 1=headphones, 2=hdmi. For example, to force the Raspberry Pi to use the analog output:
```
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
```


# port forwarding
You can use port forwarding on the router to forward a high port number to the ssh port of a
pi on my local network.

e.g. 80.111.144.159:10000 -> 192.168.1.100:22

to generate this high port number, you can multiply the final octet of the local static ip address by the power of 2

e.g. if the local 192.168.1.100, the port number used for forwarding will be:
100^2 = 10000
