I like to optimise my activies by having a workflow for each of my major interests

# development
- blog everything
- if you make/create someting make it RUN - DOCKER CONTAINER FOR EVERYTHING
	- host as much as you can on cheap/free-tier sites like
		- github pages (it can run HTML5+CSS+JS!)
		- s3 static website hosting (JS also)
    - containers means you can SWITCH cloud providers easily, all you need is cloud compute + docker
# Consuming audio/video
I have a bash script that loops through a directory of content, launches VLC to
consume the content, and places it into a `listened` folder.

This way I don't have to remember what I've listened to already.
