# Workflows
I like to optimise my activities by having a workflow for each of my major interests.

# Developing software
See [[Development]]

# Consuming audio/video
I have a bash script that loops through a directory of content, launches VLC to consume the content, and places it into a `listened` folder. This way I don't have to remember what I've listened to already.

# tracking learning progress
- start a blog post to drive and hold everything you learn (BDD)
- then write good documentation in plain english about what you want to do (README.md)
- implement your learning by writing an app using TDD as you go (learn by doing!)
- did i mention TDD?
- use todo.sr.ht with markdown tables to track your progress through chapters
	- you can also WRITE THINGS DOWN using those little columnar paper lists you like
