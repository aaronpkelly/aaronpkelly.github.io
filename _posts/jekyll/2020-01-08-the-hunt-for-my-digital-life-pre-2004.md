I had a digital life pre-2004, but records are flaky that far back in time.

Possible tools to dig up old pages:

# Services I used

## hotmail

All emails deleted. What happened -_-

## ICQ

Cannot password reset or remember my ICQ id. Maybe a friend who I spoke to back then still has it

# Other ancient mysteries

So far things have proven to be hazard free, although really I'm kind of thinking of lots of little cool things and trying to work a storyline around it. Well it goes for 2 minutes anyway, so if I screw it up, eh, no big loss :P I'm gonna try and see if I can get some extra characters happening (friends come over ALL the time, I'm thinking a bit TOO often), so  I'll write a basic script and then take it from there. Yeah. And I'll make sure it's up on this site sometime too.

I saw the  stars through veils of ash, and the sun through stinging eyes... I lived and breathed on belched fumes, where clean air was becoming as precious as clean water. And  all the while, they called it the pinnacle of modern-living. Intro Credits A friend had called me to let me know he was dropping by to pick up some cargo,  down at the docks, and I was to meet him there. He knew about my dream of  escaping from here, even if it was for a few days, I could do with the time off. INT. SpaceCraft B: Hey! What's up chucky? Welcome aboard. C: Good to see you.

Stuff about concerts and hurting people. Access the Scanmachine Rataeva's Domicile Glorious Speldiffy FRiends Recently (last thursday the 6th) Aranmore had it's annual cross country race. 2.5k for the lads, and 2 k for the gals, situated on the  picturesque banks of Lake Monger. Needless to say it was pretty good (aside from the sun, ouch). There was a huge cookup on the BBQ of which I got to get into,  not eating it, but helping out with the onion-sizzling. I came in 11th out of the yr 12 yeargroup, which is fair enough, I think, given that I had to help set up the whole damn thing beforehand, so I didn't run meh personal best. Ok, so I don't have a personal best, but damn was I buggered at the end, specially when that shit Luke beat me by a hair. Grr :P And that was Thursday. No swans were injured during the proceedings. www.runnersworld.com Good site for runners and wannabe runners :P Access the Scanmachine Rataeva's Domicile Glorious Speldiffy FRiends Ahh, weeks lay before me and I haven't even got a clue what to do with them. The way it should be. Hopefully it'll be used for just fun and concerts and stuff. Mind altering substances might make a cameo too, you neeeever know now do you. Oh, and working on flash stuff. Yeah. Cause it's fun and I'm gonna rule with world with it someday. Maybe start up something like the Heaven's Gate cult. God knows someone will believe me in the states, for sure! -->
