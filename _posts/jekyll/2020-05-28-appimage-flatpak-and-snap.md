# AppImage
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppImage

+ yay for self-contained runnables
- weird sandboxing issue requires me to run with `--no-sandbox`

A good example: https://obsidian.md/

# Flatpak
+ `chmod +x ./your_app` and your'e off

# Snaps
- Require a 'snap store' to be installed on your system
