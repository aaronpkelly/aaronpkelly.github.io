# Tools I Use (INCUBATING - I'm currently organising tools by category, rather than OS)

The following are everyday computing tools i use (or really want to believe I do) to maximise productivity, and get the most amount of enjoyment I can out of the system I'm using.

This post will be frequently updated as I discover new tools to supplant existing ones, or revert back to a trusted tool after getting far too carried away on the hype train.

A lot of these tools have been found via a combination of searching on hackernews, and using https://alternativeto.net/.

Note: The '~' character means the tool is no longer being used as much, and is in danger of being removed from the list

# Disk usage analysers

Linux: Baobab
Windows: Spacesniffer

    - cvlc: command-line version of vlc, the curses view is great: `cvlc -I curses [FILE/URI]`
    - mpg123 - quick and dirty mp3 player
    - mplayer (see note below): quick and dirty general player (FLAC support!)

- screentogif
- spacesniffer (successor to windDirStat)
- sysinternals suite
- total commander

# Browser extensions/addons

## fraidyc.at

Great way to follow things without the feeling that you need to catch-up and read everything. If you are getting the error `NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource` or similar, check that your browser's network settings are set to _Auto-detect proxy settings for this network_.

# Additional information on specific tools

## mplayer

Use in conjunction with youtube-dl to play movies in the console:

```
$ apk add mplayer youtube-dl libcaca
$ youtube-dl pec8P5K4s8c -o fireplace.mp4
$ export CACA_DRIVER=ncurses
$ mplayer -really-quiet -vo caca fireplace.mp4
```
