# Digital Ocean

First impressions very good

+ clean UI
+ very smooth deployment of marketplace app
+ helpful documentation
+ ready-to-deploy custom images!
- no free plan
	- although in May 2022 they introduced a $4 droplet - not bad

# A test deployment

I decided to try and deploy [[MeiliSearch]], to see how easy it was.

## Connecting
The docs made it very easy to SSH into my droplet:

```
âžœ  ~ ssh root@***.***.***.***
Linux meilisearch-debian-buster-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01 5.6.0-1-cloud-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.6.7-1 (2020-04-29) x86_64

________________________________________________        
                                                        
Welcome to your MeilSearch server

Thank you for using MeiliSearch.


This is the first login here, and we need to set some basic configuration first.

Do you wish to setup a MEILI_MASTER_KEY for your search engine [y/n]?  n
Do you wish to setup a domain name [y/n]? n
     --- OK, now we will set up MeiliSearch for you! --- 
 Configuration is over. Thanks
 If you want to run this script again, run the following command:
sh /var/opt/meilisearch/scripts/first-login/000-set-meili-env.sh
root@meilisearch-debian-buster-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01:~#
```

## Uploading files

I uploaded a JSON file to my droplet:

```
scp ./Documents/txt/myEmail.json root@***.***.***.***:~
```

Then ran the commands from my [[MeiliSearch]] article to create an index, and import my JSON-ified emails. I refreshed the droplet webpage, and my content was immediately searchable. Very pleasant!

# Destroying my droplet

Because of the no free plan, I tried out the service for a month, and then destroyed my droplet.

Digital Ocean do occasionally offer free credits, so I'll keep an eye out for them, but until that time the service is too expensive when I can get US$2.50 VPSs elsewhere.
