I want to play Doom eternal, but I have the following constraints:
- I've shifted completely over to Linux
- I play on a moderately powerful laptop, but I don't have a GPU, and the game needs a GPU
- I've bought Doom already on Steam, so I want to buy it again on some other cloud gaming platform

So, what are my options?

# Stadia

+ technology worked flawlessly for me. I was impressed.
+ my connection wasn't great but it didn't seem to have any problems streaming.
- you can't BYO games. You need to buy them on their platform

# NVIDIA GeForce Now

Difficult to get running under Linux, also currently the game isn't supported: https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/geforce-experience/games/


# Playstation Now

+ i hear it's good, but you need an Playstation? :)

# https://shadow.tech/int/

Heard good things about this but it's not available in my country (yet).

# https://workstream.paperspace.com/

It's a bit janky to setup - the website is slightly confusing, and there's an approval process if you want a modern GPU which is a bit annoying (you need to send them a message as to why you want it).

Also, I just assumed their base offering would support Parsec screen sharing, but the GPU wasn't supported. Apparently I should have gone to the _Public Templates_ list and chosen the 'Parsec' template from there.

# https://parsecgaming.com/

Low latency screen sharing optimised for game streaming. I found this service fantastic! I currently use it conjunction with workstream. 

# Steam Cloud Gaming (TBA)

Valve's cloud gaming service. TBA. Would love to try this
