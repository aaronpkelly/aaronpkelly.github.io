# Stadia
+ streams through a browser, no downloads
+ technology worked flawlessly for me
- you can't BYO game store. You need to buy games on Stadia

# NVIDIA GeForce Now
+ streaming client, no downloads
+ BYO game store
+ free 1 hour sessions
- requires a compatible device

# Paperspace
+ best service I've found running a Windows 10 gaming machine in the cloud
+ good alternative to get access to game subscription services that only provide PC installers (Playstation Now for PC), or the Battle.net client
+ provides the Paperspace App[0] for optimised streaming
- cannot run XBOX Game Pass for PC because the Parsec public template is Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Datacenter
- can be unintuitive to setup a gaming rig, and there was previously an approval process if you wanted a modern GPU which is a bit annoying (you need to send them a message as to why you want it)

[0]: which is in fact the Pasec client - https://parsecgaming.com/ - low latency screen sharing optimised for game streaming. Use `./Paperspace.sh` to launch, not `./Paperspace`

# Playstation Now for PC
+ streaming client, no downloads
+ subscription service gives instant access to library
+ don't need to own a PS, just need a DualShock controller and a PS account
- client is PC only

# Shadow
+ streaming client
+ heard good things about this service
- not available in my country (yet)

# Steam Cloud Gaming (TBA)
Valve's cloud gaming service. TBA. Would love to try this

# XBOX Game Pass for PC
+ subscription service gives access to large library
+ has access to games that you can't get anywhere else, like MS Flight Simulator
- non-streaming client, have to download games
- client is PC only
