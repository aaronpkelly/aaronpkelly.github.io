## ProtonDB-Tags

https://github.com/CorruptComputer/ProtonDB-Tags - Pull ratings from [202207091421 ProtonDB](202207091421%20ProtonDB.md) and import them into your Steam library as tags.

To run on Nix:	

	$ nix-shell -p python3 python39Packages.pip
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt -t pip_requirements
	$ PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/pip_requirements python ProtonDB-Tags.py --check-native --fetch-games

## Depressurizer

Yes there is also Depressurizer - "A Steam library categorizing tool", but it's windows only... and a bit overkill (still good tho): https://github.com/rallion/depressurizer/releases

# skins

I like a compact, clean skin. Currrently I'm using Compact-1.6.30.
Then I will use compact-mode. Tiny steam client!
