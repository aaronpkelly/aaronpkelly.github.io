# It kind of works

I use Obsidian to not only take notes, but to also write blog posts.

I currently use a custom bash script to make some modifications to my posts at build time to a format that works for Github pages. Github will then build a static HTML site for me.

So, it kind of works.

What's really broken are the links between articles, the soul of what my makes a blog great.

I decided to either try and fix it myself, or try using a tool written by someone else.

# Should I let Github pages continue to generate my HTML

I think I'd prefer to do it myself... but there is one thing I'd like to try first

# What FREE static html publishing tools are out there?

# the paid option - Obsidian publish

I want to avoid doing this for now: https://help.obsidian.md/Index
