# Rust
I don't have anything magical to share just yet

# rustup

On MX Linux their rust package is a bit behind. I used the rustup script from rust's own website, does the trick NICLEY. Stable channel

# Projects

I have an CLI client called 'crust' that I want to use to interact with my API ('Dorknet').

This is a good place to pour all my learning

# Rust playground

Great place to experiment! https://play.rust-lang.org/

# REPLs

A wild REPL appears! These are very handy for embedding into blog posts. Here's one:

# Testing

Rust is a bit different in that you don't use separate files to test other files, your tests live in the same file as your source code.

By default, only the `main.rs` and `lib.rs` files are compiled for any folder, and any files that they reference as a module, e.g. `mod myUtils`
