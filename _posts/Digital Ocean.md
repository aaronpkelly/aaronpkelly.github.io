# Digital Ocean

First impressions very good!
+ clean UI
+ very smooth deployment of marketplace app
+ helpful documentation
- no free plan

Because of the no free plan, I tried out the service for a month, and then destroyed my droplet.

# A test deployment

I decided to try and deploy [[MeiliSearch]], to see how easy it was.

## Connecting
The docs made it very easy to SSH into my droplet:

```
âžœ  ~ ssh root@***.***.***.***
Linux meilisearch-debian-buster-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01 5.6.0-1-cloud-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.6.7-1 (2020-04-29) x86_64

Thank you for using MeiliSearch.


This is the first login here, and we need to set some basic configuration first.

Do you wish to setup a MEILI_MASTER_KEY for your search engine [y/n]?  n
Do you wish to setup a domain name [y/n]? n
     --- OK, now we will set up MeiliSearch for you! --- 
 Configuration is over. Thanks
 If you want to run this script again, run the following command:
sh /var/opt/meilisearch/scripts/first-login/000-set-meili-env.sh
root@meilisearch-debian-buster-s-1vcpu-1gb-fra1-01:~#
```

## Uploading files

I uploaded a JSON file to my droplet:

```
scp ./Documents/txt/myEmail.json root@***.***.***.***:~
```

Then ran the commands from my [[MeiliSearch]] article to create an index, and import my JSON-ified emails. I refreshed the droplet webpage, and my content was immediately searchable. Very pleasant!
