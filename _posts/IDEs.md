I like IDEs. I also like trying out the latest IDE innovations.

My preferences would be for using containerised, cloud-based IDEs and workflows.

# https://repl.it/

When I need a quick and dirty environment to crank out some code, work on a small algorithm or program, or try out a new programming language, I use this. It's fantastic. 

I also use this service to embed code snippets on my blog, and it works really well.

# Cloud9 (AWS)
To be totally honest, I don't use the full functionality of this online IDE. I mainly spin up an instance when I need a shell in the cloud, and the fact that it has Docker pre-installed is very useful also - as I use that a lot.

I mainly use the service for quick programming projects, usually ones that integrate with AWS services.
