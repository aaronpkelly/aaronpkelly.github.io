I like IDEs. I also like trying out the latest IDE innovations.

My preferences would be for using containerised, cloud-based IDEs and workflows.

# https://repl.it/

When I need a quick and dirty environment to crank out some code, work on a
small algorithm or program, or try out a new programming language, I use this.
It's fantastic

# Cloud9 (AWS)
To be totally honest, I don't use the full functionality of this online IDE.
I mainly spin up an instance when I need a shell in the cloud, and the fact
that it has Docker pre-installed is very useful also - as I use that a lot.

I mainly use the service for quick programming projects, usually ones that
integrate with AWS services.

# Gitpod.io

Based on Eclipse Theia.

A short while ago I was on the hunt for a way to edit the code that was
checked-in to my github repositories easily. Gitlab offer an online IDE, but
Github don't. That's when I found Gitpod. I'm using it right now to create
this post.

Really great service to use if you need a quick, disposable IDE to edit your
project code.
