A crazy idea I had recently, was for every idea or small project that I want to attempt... start a blog entry for it. Then, I can use that blog entry to help me with my development.

Benefits:

- a good starting point to let ideas run free. A journal for my thoughts
- more planning and reasoning ahead of time. Increase efficiency!
- a comprehensive, annotated record of tasks and steps performed
- immediately creating value from my efforts

Funnily enough, a guy on hackernews also suggested this as a good method, I'm glad I'm not the only crazy person: [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22778123)
