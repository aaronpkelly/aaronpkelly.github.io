# How it started

I saw [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/03/11/projector-is-out/):

> Have you ever wanted to run your IDE on a server to code remotely from a laptop or tablet? Today marks the release of Projector, a tool and framework for running JetBrains IDEs and Swing apps remotely over your network. It's very fast, open-source, and has the potential to become one of the best solutions for remote IDE access.
