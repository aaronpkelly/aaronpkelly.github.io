# News - you don't need to stay up-to-date

I tried to read/consume everything today
It doesn't matter
Everything is derivative

News that you read today about past events will have summaries, contain more context, and a long-term view which is more informative

# Artists and albums

Artistic works that are created today often don't deviate all that much from the middle of the bell curve - they have strong echoes and influences of previous works - so in effect, when listening to an album today, your listening to everything that came before it

## outliers
Of course, there are always significan outliers that stand on their own. Listen to them!
