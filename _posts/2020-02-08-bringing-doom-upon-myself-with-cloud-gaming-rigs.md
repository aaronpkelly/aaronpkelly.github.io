I want to play Doom eternal, but I have the following constraints:
- I've shifted completely over to Linux
- I play on a moderately powerful laptop, but I don't have a GPU, and the game needs a GPU
- I've bought Doom already on Steam, so I want to buy it again on some other cloud gaming platform

So, what are my options?

# Stadia

+ technology worked flawlessly for me. I was impressed.
+ my connection wasn't great but it didn't seem to have any problems streaming.
- you can't BYO games. You need to buy them on their platform

# NVIDIA GeForce Now

+ BYO games (steam store etc)
+ free 1 hour session per day
+ powerful gaming rig
- need a _very_ good internet connection

# Playstation Now

+ i hear it's good, but you need an Playstation? :)
