I've written a small tool that can generate playlists from a flat file -
*Playlist Generator*!

Previously I used a spreadsheet to keep track of the mp3 streaming URLs that
online radio stations use, and used some functions to generate the appropriate
`.pls` formatted output, but it felt very cumbersome to me.

The tool outputs playlists in the `.pls` from a simple input file, and outputs
in the `.pls` format most commonly used in conjunction with media players such
as VLC.

The project is available on github:
