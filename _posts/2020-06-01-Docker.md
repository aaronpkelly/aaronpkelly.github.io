# Docker

Here lies a collection of useful tricks and tips I've found from working with Docker and containers in general for the last while.

# Building

## Building a Docker image from a Git repository

Handy to know:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#git-repositories

# Logs
Tailing the STDOUT of a docker container - yes we can!:

```
docker logs --follow <CONTAINER>
```

# Container management
I typically just run containers on a cheap [[VPS]]

## Watching for new images
There is a tool like [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower ) that can restart them when image is updated.

There was also a post on HN where the same thing was accomplished by:
- pushing to a git remote on a cheap VPS
- git hook in that repo has a command that starts/restarts the container
