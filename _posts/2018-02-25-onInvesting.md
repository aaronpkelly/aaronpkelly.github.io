# Broker
Use `degiro.nl` - very low fees
Strongly advise not to market order, always set a limit.

## stop loss
> if I am buying a share @ say $2.70 and want to minimise losses - what type of order do I input. Say if the price is falling and I want to set it to sell @ $2.60
To minimise losses: use Sell Option; Order Type : Stop Loss and enter price [$2.60].

## Limit order
> Also when selling if a share is at $3.00 and I want to take a profit at a minimum of $2.90 - can I set up an order so that the position I hold will be automatically sold once the share price hits $2.90

To take profit @ $2.90: use Sell; Order Type : Limit Order & enter price $2.90

## degiro terms
Market order: will get you the deal done immediately (you may have to suffer a slightly worse price then if you place a limit order)
Limit order: you set a maximum price you are willing to pay. The order won't be filled until another seller drops to that price.
Day order: only lasts for the day - if it doesn't get filled it's cancelled.
GTC: good till cancelled

# Acronyms
## ETF
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks

ET = "exchange-traded"
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.

F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.

If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.
