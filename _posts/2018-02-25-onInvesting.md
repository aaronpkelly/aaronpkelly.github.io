# Acronyms
## ETF
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks

ET = "exchange-traded"
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.

F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.

If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.
