Current status: UNSUCCESSFUL

I've tried this service on Windows and it's fantastic:

+ BYO games (steam store etc)
+ free 1 hour session per day
+ powerful gaming rig
- need a _very_ good internet connection

However it's very difficult to get this application running in Linux.

# Emulation

I've made some efforts on this (qemu?) but I didn't track them

# Hardware (Android Phone)

I have a spare Android Phone (Samsung Galaxy J36), and as Android is one of the [supported devices](https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/geforce-now/download/) I thought I'd try doing the following:

- run GeForce Now on Android
- on my Linux machine, use _Steam Remote Play_ to connect to the Steam instance that's running inside my Android phone

When I went to download the app on the Play Store, it said my device wasn't supported. This is a shame as the phone was only released in 2016!

There is an alternative: install the application as an APK, however this will be considered an untrusted source. I don't care though, I won't be using this phone for anything else.
