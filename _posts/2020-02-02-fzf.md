# FZF
I discovered this program recently, and it's so good I had to write a post about it

## keybinds
The install script adds:
- `CTRL+R`
- `CTRL+T`
- `ALT-C`

In my `zsh` shell these weren't enabled by default, maybe one day I'll figure out how to enable them.

## Killer features
These options are what make `fzf` great for me

	--preview
	Opens a preview pane to view the output of the command. The preview pane also supports ANSI colours, so you can use any program that takes full advantage of this (syntax highlighting...)
	
	--multi (-m)
	Allows you to select multiple results with `TAB`. Pressing `ENTER` will echo the results back you to your terminal, or optionally, can be passed to a program.

# Useful fzf queries

NOTE: more programming-specific queries are in [A REPL for shell commands]({% post_url 2017-09-24-A-REPL-for-shell-commands %})


Note: most of the below queries will by default have the `--multi` (`-m`) option enabled.


## find and run program (e.g. midi player)

Here you go, a midi player which can easily search through 1000's of files

	fzf --multi --preview 'timidity {}'

## find in file (put this in API if it looks useful):

```
#!/bin/bash

grep --line-buffered --color=never -r "" * | fzf

# with ag - respects .agignore and .gitignore
ag --nobreak --nonumbers --noheading . | fzf

# using ripgrep combined with preview
# find-in-file - usage: fif <searchTerm>
fif() {
  if [ ! "$#" -gt 0 ]; then echo "Need a string to search for!"; return 1; fi
  rg --files-with-matches --no-messages "$1" | fzf --preview "highlight -O ansi -l {} 2> /dev/null | rg --colors 'match:bg:yellow' --ignore-case --pretty --context 10 '$1' || rg --ignore-case --pretty --context 10 '$1' {}"
}
```

## Find file by name and display contents

Find a file by name and display its contents in the preview pane:

```
fzf --preview 'find . -type f -name {q} | head -100 {}'
```

## Search for file contents (using grep/ripgrep)
The contents of the file will be dispalyed in the search results:

```
grep --line-buffered --color=never --ignore-case --recursive "" | fzf
```

## Generate a list, mark rows, perform action
This is useful for tasks such as:
- searching bash history, marking command(s) you want to rerun, and running them as soon as `fzf` exits
- searching currently installed programs, marking them, and upgrading only the marked ones

### Searching bash history, execute command
A good replacement for bash's history search `CTRL+R` is the _built-in_ history search that comes with `fzf`:


You can also create your own!:

```
history | fzf -m | cut -c 8- | bash
```

### Searching for installed applications and upgrading them

In this example, the results are processed using `cut` and then saved to a variable:

```
~ RST=$(apt list --installed | eval "fzf ${FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS} -m --header='search'" | cut -d '/' -f 1)
~ echo $RST
asciinema
baobab
```

Instead of saving to a variable, you could immediately pass those results to a program:

```
~ sudo apt install --only-upgrade $(apt list --installed | eval "fzf ${FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS} -m --header='search'" | cut -d '/' -f 1)

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

## Instant search (WIKIs, search engines..)
Very handy when you want to get instant results! This uses `w3m --dump` to format the html page into plain text.

DuckDuckGo:

```
 : | fzf --multi --preview 'w3m -dump https://duckduckgo.com/\?q\={q}' --preview-window=up:70
```

Wikipedia - the exact title must match for the article to be found:

```
: | fzf --multi --preview 'w3m -dump https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{q}' --preview-window=up:70
```

Dark Souls 3 wiki - I remove the first n lines because it's all boilerplate HTML:

```
: | fzf --multi --preview 'w3m -dump https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/{q} | tail -n +344' --preview-window=up:70
```

Or even better:
