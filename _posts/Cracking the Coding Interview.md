# about
I decide to tackle some of the challenges given in this book, and try to have a frank an honest code review of both my solution, and the solution in the book.

I'm by no means a Java expert, but I do want to have a go at critically code reviewing both my code and the book's.

# source
I'll be checking in all my code to this git repo:
