I love APIs. I've created some backend APIs for websites that I use heavily, but
which don't offer a public API.

# Accomplice

I recently created a project,
[accopmlice](www.github.com/aaronpkelly/accomplice), to help me quickly get the
data I need before I start my commute in the morning.

Currently it is my personal API, callable from anywhere with an internet
connection.

The data exposed by my API is useful in that it is hard or difficult to get
the same results using another publically available API - in most cases I've
needed to parse JSON data from an external site and expose only what I need.

In some cases, the data that is being parsed was not intended to be visible to
a normal user.

- strength of having a personal API
