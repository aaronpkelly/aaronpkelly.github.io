# Torrenting basics

- go to https://yts.mx/ or http://proxybay.github.io/ (choose a mirror)
- search for something you want
- copy the magnet link of the torrent
- use an online seedbox service to stream/download your torrent

Alternatively, if you don't want to use a seedbox, you can use a program on your machine to do it, but your ISP may be able to detect what you're doing: 
- rtorrent (linux)
- qbittorrent (windows)

# any other good torrent sites?

## magazines

https://downmagaz.net/ seems to be the most comprehensive for magazines, but the free download links are awful - they make you wait 10 mins

# Seedboxes

## Seedr
The only decent free service I've found so far.

A seedbox service which accepts a magnet/torrent link, downloads the media you
requested, then lets you watch/stream it through the browser. No need to
download anything.
