# AWS
This post will deal with general AWS stuff that I've learned and experienced that doesn't fit into a specific AWS article. It will also link to my other AWS articles.

# What I use it for
Blob storage mainly:
- I compress videos with [[ffmpeg]], upload them, and then stream/watch them through my browser with a direct link

# Pros and Cons
+ some very useful and mature services like blob storage (s3) and secret storage (ssm))
- costs. I've been overcharged grossly for just 'experimenting' and 'trying out' services on their platform. In fairness, they have refunded me, but I don't feel like I always know what I'm going to be charged for at the end of the month
- UI is slow and frustrating
