structured programming:  
\- who invented it? Edward Djikstra, very interesting fellow  
\- wrote "goto is considered harmful", at the time GOTO was everything and everywhere  
  - what was harmful about goto?  
      - not mathematically sound, some algorithms could not be proven correct, when they had unrestrained GOTO's  
      - Alan Turing first mentioned this in the "halting problem"  
  - every algorithm can be composed of 3 structures, and they can be proved correct if using them:  
      - sequence  
      - selection (if/else)  
      - iteration (loops)  
\- however, Dijkstra failed (or we failed Dijkstra!), because we don't go and prove that every program of software is correct  
  - its too hard  
  - instead, we use TESTS  
  - we demonstrate our software is "not incorrect" by surrounding it with tests
