> This whitepaper describes the AWS Well-Architected Framework. It provides guidance to help customers apply [best practices](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.best-practice.en.html "Proven ways of achieving successful outcomes.") in the design, delivery, and maintenance of AWS environments. We address general design principles as well as specific [best practices](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.best-practice.en.html "Proven ways of achieving successful outcomes.") and guidance in five conceptual areas that we define as the _pillars_ of the Well-Architected Framework.

Regardless of my feelings toward AWS this is a great guide
