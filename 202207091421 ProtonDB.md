Proton is the name that Valve give to their fork of Wine that runs Windows games on Linux

A great community search site for ProtonDB-compatible games is https://www.protondb.com/:

	The goal of ProtonDB is to gather reports from other gamers as they test games with Proton on Linux and provide aggregate scores of how well games perform. A growing pool of suggestions provides tweaks that you can try to get games working while Proton continues development. In addition to this, you may explore the Steam game catalog on this site to browse and discover a wide range of titles that were previously unavailable for use on Linux.

You can turn ProtonDB ratings into steam categories with a tool, see [202207091300 steam tools](202207091300%20steam%20tools.md)
