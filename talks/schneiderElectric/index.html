# Challenges faced - Climate change

.middle[![climateChange](http://i.imgur.com/eqZTlqK.jpg)]

???

"challenges that we face from an energy management perspective globally"

Here's my take:
- Today, climate change is a dominant issue
- Energy efficiency must be at the heart of all solutions in order to meet climate goals
    - products and services built with efficiency in mind from ground up
    - low-carbon footprint required for the entire manufacturing pipeline
    - products and services must be sustainabile and durable when deployed

# Challenges faced - Energy Crisis

.middle[![aleppo](http://i.imgur.com/hIV2CSz.jpg)]

???

- Growing population demands more energy
- Developing countries
    - energy infrastructure is unreliable
    - clean energy infrastructure may not exist
- This situation can contribute to earlier problem, climate change
- Can lead to an energy crisis (a bottleneck of energy)

# Future Policies, Practices and Trends

.middle[![future](http://i.imgur.com/PkRxUiE.jpg)]

???

possible future policies, practices and trends that may affect the way we do our business in the future

- The company's strategic focus will need to be flexible in response to new energy technology and R&D
- Energy community have complex interests, and demand for products and services can change
    - future energy requirements of residential and industrial markets (clean energy, energy storage)
    - can be public opposition to large-scale energy investments
- Political turmoil on the world stage is very common at present
- A more balanced exposure to strategic markets will help moderate price fluctuations
- A focus on not just adding new products, but also maintaining the legacy portfolio (electricity distribution, automation, industrial control)
- Sustained investment in new and emerging economies
