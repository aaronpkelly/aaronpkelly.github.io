I like music discovery, so I like thes sites:

https://bandcamp.com/ : artist-first music streaming site. Incredible

https://radio.garden/ - i use radio.garden to seek out the strangest, most remote places on earth and listen to their music and their community

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma.fm - One of my favourite sites to listen to music online is SomaFM:  I found them when reading about Defcon - SomaFM provide the music for one of the chillout rooms at the event. I find myself usually listening to the least popular stations, because they're more interesting to me.  There is also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di.fm which is decent, but more
mainstream

http://everynoise.com/ - every music genre, and a playlist to boot

http://forgotify.com : Forgotify â€“ Be the First Person to Hear a Song!
