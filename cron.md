# similar services (cron as a service)

a big list: https://www.cronjobservices.com/

https://www.easycron.com/ seems really good, but it only sends HTTP requests (e.g. to APIs)

some i googled by myself and are not in the above list:

https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/ (only 3 free jobs, bit of a joke)
https://render.com/docs/cronjobs

https://git.sr.ht/~aaronkelly/cron-in-the-cloud: my simple cron in the cloud, which I'll make if the above services are lacking in something
