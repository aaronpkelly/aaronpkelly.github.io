# Qemu
I've made some efforts on this (qemu?) but I didn't track them.

# Anbox
Seems to be the best... BUT... needs two modules (ashmem and binder) that require a system to be booted with SYSTEMD

There is software called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anbox that can run a good emulation of Android phones. It requires installation via a SNAP image (yuk - see [[appimage flatpak and snap]]), but there is a great docker image of Anbox [here](https://github.com/aind-containers/aind)
