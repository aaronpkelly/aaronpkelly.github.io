# Sites I like 

I don't want to say _bookmarks_ cos I'm trying to get away from saving bookmarks, and plus these sites are extra special!

https://radio.garden/ - i use radio.garden to seek out the strangest, most remote places on earth and listen to their music and their community

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma.fm - One of my favourite sites to listen to music online is SomaFM:  I found them when reading about Defcon - SomaFM provide the music for one of the chillout rooms at the event. I find myself usually listening to the least popular stations, because they're more interesting to me.  There is also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di.fm which is decent, but more
mainstream

http://everynoise.com/ - every music genre, and a playlist to boot

https://openlibrary.org/ - an open-source version of Goodreads! Export your books using the tool from the 'My Books' section to a CSV file, and import them to Openlibrary!
