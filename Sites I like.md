# Sites I like 

I don't want to say _bookmarks_ cos I'm trying to get away from saving bookmarks, and plus these sites are extra special!

https://radio.garden/ - i use radio.garden to seek out the strangest, most remote places on earth and listen to their music and their community

https://openlibrary.org/ - an open-source version of Goodreads! Export your books using the tool from the 'My Books' section to a CSV file, and import them to Openlibrary!
