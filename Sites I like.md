# Sites I like 

I don't want to say _bookmarks_ cos I'm trying to get away from saving bookmarks, and plus these sites are extra special!

https://openlibrary.org/ - an open-source version of Goodreads! Export your books using the tool from the 'My Books' section to a CSV file, and import them to Openlibrary!
