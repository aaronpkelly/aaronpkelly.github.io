prefer exceptions to returning error codes:  
  
\- it is better to use an exception than to return a error code  
\- if Bob has a try block in a fuction, the \_only\_ thing in the function is the try block  
  - there is nothing else, just the try block  
  - error processing is one thing  
  - do not nest try/catch blocks

- coding a better world together (with uncle bob)
