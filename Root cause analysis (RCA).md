> Applying the RCA process help you understand the causes of a failure, and how to prevent it from happening again in the future.
> 
> Effective RCA requires a focus on eliminating the [problem](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.problem.en.html "An event that requires intervention and either recurs or cannot currently be resolved."), rather than just understanding it. You should be wary of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias?ref=wellarchitected-ws) that make you focus on recent occurrences (vs all), or looking for data that confirms your assumptions.

General process:

-   Define [problem](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.problem.en.html "An event that requires intervention and either recurs or cannot currently be resolved.")
-   Collect Data
-   Identify Root Causes
    -   Use [Five whys](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.fivewhys.en.html "Helps in identifying the root cause of a problem by determining the relationship between different root causes of a problem.") and [Ishikawa diagrams](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.ishikawadiagram.en.html "Helps in capturing the causal relationship between cause and effect, and groups causes into meaningful groupings.")
-   Implement Countermeasures
-   Evaluate & Follow-up
