# origin

- Java started life as a language called Oak, invented by James Gosling, because of his hate for C++. He was working at Sun Microsystems, and they got a contract to write software for a set-top box. He invented a language for the purpose of the contract, then threw it in the bin
  - an accident of history resurrected his language, Sun wanted a language to appeal and sell hardware to programmers
  - C# is Java (pretty much!)

## whats new

these oracle-provided "whats new" pages are great, but they don't seem to provide them for all JDKs: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8-whats-new.html

# learning

the oracle-written The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials are very sufficient. They are written for JDK8: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html

# uis
## swing
It's used by IntelliJ to build their IDE - probably the only success story of swing :P

Oracle provide a Swing tutorial, with a sample file:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/start/compile.html

Use IntelliJ's Swing UI Designer to build UIs:
- you will use IntelliJ's _forms_ to help you design the UI, which will create the needed classes
- right-click the elements on your forms, add actionlisteners, and code them up
