# uis
## swing
It's used by IntelliJ to build their IDE - probably the only success story of swing :P

Oracle provide a Swing tutorial, with a sample file:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/start/compile.html

Use IntelliJ's Swing UI Designer to build UIs:
- you will use IntelliJ's _forms_ to help you design the UI, which will create the needed classes
- right-click the elements on your forms, add actionlisteners, and code them up
