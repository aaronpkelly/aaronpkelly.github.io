Hi I'm Aaron, and I like to break things for a living.

Occassionally, I'll try to put them back together to see how they work!

# Posts
Below are my posts! They are the main focus of this website. They contain
information and opinion about a particular topic, and hopefully be well curated,
revised, and updated over time.

Some posts will take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have
created to share my experiences on a particular topic.
