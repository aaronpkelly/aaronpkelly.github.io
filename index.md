Note: I know that Github pages has amazing jekyll support, but it's just noise.
Just use basic markdown for all content. Any content that does not have a .md
extension won't be published here.# What's on my website?

## Vision
- create value from everything
- why is a doc in a private repo? expose it. move all docs from private repos into my website. everything else should be considered a publically viewable doc
- try to monetize some good ideas
- keep the number of repos in your ~environment to a minumum, to eliminate task switching


Turn each of your public docs into a post.
There is value in sharing them

all development projects should have their own markdown file, or if they are an
incubating idea, be listed in _myProjects.md_.

## _on.._ series
Documents beginning with _on.._ will contain collected wisdom about a particular
topic.
any general writing should be in a file prefixed with _on*_, e.g. *onFinance.md*[docs/2017-07-01-containersAndJekyll.md](docs/2017-07-01-containersAndJekyll.md)
