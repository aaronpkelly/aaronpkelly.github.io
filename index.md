"Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines
to execute" - (SICP)

Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm good at breaking things for a living, and occasionally I'll
try and put them back together.

# Posts
Below are my posts! They are the main focus of this website. They contain
information and opinion about a particular topic, and hopefully be well curated,
revised, and updated over time.

Some posts will take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have
created to share my experiences on a particular topic.

# My vision for this site

- create value from everything I do
- expose as much of my work as I can into the public domain
- keep it simple and no fuss 
- make it presentable and shareable
- use basic markdown

# Other sites

I have a bunch of other websites that you may find interesting:

[PetiteSheets](http://app-bucket-petitesheets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

[Screentime.cc](http://screentime.cc.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

I also created some APIs for websites that I use heavily, but don't offer a
public API themselves. Below are the websites that act as a front-end to these
APIs:

[TinyTimetable - DublinBikes](http://app-bucket-dublin-bike-tinytimetable.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

[TinyTimetable - DublinBus](http://app-bucket-dublin-bus-tinytimetable.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
