# TODO
- get as much stuff out of here and into relevant sites. bookmarks should be in
hackernews/github, computer stuff should be in secrets repo etc

# Overview
Note: I know that Github pages has amazing jekyll support, but it's just noise.
Just use basic markdown for all content. Any content that does not have a .md
extension won't be published here.# What's on my website?

## Vision
- create value from everything
- why is a doc in a private repo? expose it. move all docs from private repos into my website. everything else should be considered a publically viewable doc
- try to monetize some good ideas
- keep the number of repos in your ~environment to a minumum, to eliminate task switching

Turn each of your public docs into a post.
There is value in sharing them

all development projects should have their own markdown file, or if they are an
incubating idea, be listed in _myProjects.md_.

# Posts
One of the major sections of this website.

Information and opinion about a particular topic, hopefully be well curated.
Posts will be revisted over time and updated.

Some posts will take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have
created to share my experiences in a particular topic.
