to execute" - (SICP)

Howdy, I'm Aaron, and I'm really good at breaking things. So much so, I've made a living out of it! If the mood takes me, I'll even try putting them back together ;)

# Posts

Posts are the the main focus of my website. My aim for them is to contain insightful, well-curated and to-the-point information about a particular topic. They will also be revised and updated over time.

Some posts will have different flavours and focus. Some will exist simply to  share my narrow experiences on a particular topic, however some may take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have compiled over a long period of time.

Psst... if you want the RSS feed, it's [here](https://aaronpkelly.github.io/feed.xml).

## Runnable code examples

I use embedded code examples in some posts, courtesy of https://repl.it!

If for some reason you cannot see the code inside these embeds, you may be using a browser (e.g. Brave) which is blocking style elements needed to display them. If you would like to see the text properly, you should whitelist my site (in Brave's case, choosing 'Shields Down for this site').

# Incubating posts

Some posts just aren't ready for the limelight yet.

However, if you wish to get a preview of what's coming up, they are available in
my git repo as they're being written: [link](https://github.com/aaronpkelly/aaronpkelly.github.io/tree/master/_posts).

# Why do this

I decided that writing about my interests is a good way for me to:

- create value from everything I do
- keep the content simple and to the point 
- make it presentable and shareable
- expose everything I do in the public domain. Hopefully, it will be useful to
someone somewhere (I like helping people!), and it will encourage me to keep my
standards up

# Turn that post into a sparkly PDF

PDFs of all my articles will soon be on https://gumroad.com, using "pay what you
want" pricing.

# APIs

Below are some static frontend websites that use my APIs a the backend:

# Other projects that I'd like to monetize someday

I have a bunch of other pet projects that I occasionally work on from time to
time, with a hope to charging a small monthly membership for.
