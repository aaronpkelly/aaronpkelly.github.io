Hi I'm Aaron, I like to break things for a living.

# Posts
One of the major sections of this website.
Information and opinion about a particular topic, hopefully be well curated.
Posts will be revisted over time and updated.
Some posts will take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have
created to share my experiences in a particular topic.

# Vision for this site
- create value from everything
- why is a doc in a private repo? expose it. move all docs from private repos into my website. everything else should be considered a publically viewable doc
- try to monetize some good ideas
- keep the number of repos in your ~environment to a minumum, to eliminate task switching
- get as much stuff out of here and into relevant sites. bookmarks should be in
hackernews/github, computer stuff should be in secrets repo etc
- I know that Github pages has amazing jekyll support, but it's just noise.
Just use basic markdown for all content. Any content that does not have a .md
extension won't be published here.# What's on my website?
- Turn each of your public docs into a post. There is value in sharing them
- ? all development projects should have their own markdown file, or if they are an
incubating idea, be listed in _myProjects.md_.
