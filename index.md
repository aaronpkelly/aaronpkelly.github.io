"Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines
to execute" - (SICP)

Howdy, I'm Aaron, and I'm really good at breaking things. I've even made a living out of it. Sometimes, just sometimes... I'll even try to put those things back together, and learn something in the process!

# Posts

Posts are the the main focus of my website. My aim for them is to contain insightful, well-curated and to-the-point information about a particular topic. They will also be revised and updated over time.

Some posts will have different flavours and focus. Some will exist simply to  share my narrow experiences on a particular topic, however some may take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have compiled over a long period of time.

Psst... if you want the RSS feed, it's [here](https://aaronpkelly.github.io/feed.xml).

# Incubating posts

Some posts just aren't ready for the limelight yet.

However, if you wish to get a preview of what's coming up, they are available in
my git repo as they're being written: [link](https://github.com/aaronpkelly/aaronpkelly.github.io/tree/master/_posts).

# Turn that post into a sparkly PDF

PDFs of all my articles will soon be on https://gumroad.com, using "pay what you
want" pricing.

# Why do this

I decided that writing about my interests is a good way for me to:

- create value from everything I do
- keep the content simple and to the point 
- make it presentable and shareable
- expose everything I do in the public domain. Hopefully, it will be useful to
someone somewhere (I like helping people!), and it will encourage me to keep my
standards up

# APIs

I love APIs. I've created some backend APIs for websites that I use heavily, but
who don't offer a public API - frustrating!

Below are some static frontend websites that use my APIs a the backend:

[TinyTimetable - DublinBikes](http://app-bucket-dublin-bike-tinytimetable.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

[TinyTimetable - DublinBus](http://app-bucket-dublin-bus-tinytimetable.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

[TinyWeather](http://app-bucket-weather-dublin-tinyweather.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

# Other projects that I'd like to monetize someday

I have a bunch of other pet projects that I occasionally work on from time to
time, with a hope to charging a small monthly membership for.
