This repo is the source for my website [https://aaronpkelly.github.io](https://aaronpkelly.github.io)

Previously, I ran the following command to generate links to posts on the main
page, and also to generate table of contents for each article:
```
./generate.sh
```

BUT on RSS readers, this would show every article as being updated, which I
don't want. So I'm back to doing things manually!
