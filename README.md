# About

This repo is the source for my website [https://aaronpkelly.github.io](https://aaronpkelly.github.io)

# How this blog is generated

I edit the following files:
- HEADER.md
- FOOTER.md

Then I run generateIndexAndPostsList.sh to generate:
- POSTS.md
- index.md

Because I have tweaked my Github Pages site a little to take advantage of Jekyll, I also get a RSS feed generated for me at 

# History - the Strange Tale of the RSS Feed

If you want a little history of how I started out on this blog, you should read [this post]().
