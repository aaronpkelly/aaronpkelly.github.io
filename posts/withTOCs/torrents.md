# Torrenting basics
Start at https://pirateproxy.ch/ and choose a mirror

Use an online seedbox service to stream/download your torrent

Alternatively use a binary to do it:
- rtorrent (linux)
- qbittorrent (windows)

# Seedboxes
## Seedr
The only decent free service I've found so far.

A seedbox service which accepts a magnet/torrent link, downloads the media you
requested, then lets you watch/stream it through the browser. No need to
download anything.
