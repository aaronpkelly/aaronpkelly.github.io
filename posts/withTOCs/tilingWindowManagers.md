I like tiling window managers. I find it really hard to find an i3 equivalent on
Windows.

For a while I've been using Plumb: http://palatialsoftware.com/plumb/.
Happy with it for the most part!

I did try using bug.n, but it couldn't capture my VLC window to resize it, even
when I gave it the exact window details. That was a deal-breaker.

There are new tiling window managers I have seen recenty, via post on this site:

They are:
- https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/master/src/modules/fancyzones/README.md: open-source microsoft tool
- https://www.workspacer.org/

I will try them both out an report back!
