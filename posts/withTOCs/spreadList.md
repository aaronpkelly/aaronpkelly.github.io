I don't like to be rushed. I hate doing huge chunks of things at one time, when
they can just as easily be spread out over a period of time. Less stress, more
success!

So I decided to write a tool that would let me define:
- what my tasks were
- how much time I had available to do the tasks

The tool would then create cutoff times for each task, spread out evenly over
the total time period. An alarm would be attached to each cutoff time, which
meant a task *must* be done by that time.
