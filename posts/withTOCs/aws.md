This post will deal with general AWS stuff that I've learned and experienced
that don't fit into a specific AWS article.

# The Move to AWS

I'm moving to AWS with a big backpack... I have about 80 Github repositories,
and previously my only interaction with AWS was running a Jenkins instance on
EC2.

Yes - the whole show is on the move, and I think the only repository I will end
up keeping is this one, in order to avail of the free hosted github.io website.
