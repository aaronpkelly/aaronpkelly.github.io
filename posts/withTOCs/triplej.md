One of the radio stations of my youth.

I've almost finishing listening to every tripleJ _Hottest 100_ album from
1988-present.

I'm currently on 2018, and I've just realised just now... this is the most
recent album. My god.

There have been some great songs, but most are average. There are some awful
tracks also and I don't understand how they get voted on.

I'm really glad I decided to do it, there's been some classic tracks I'd
totally forgotten about, and some brilliant discoveries.

I made a small playlist using only tracks from their 2017 album, which
I consider one of their best:

Actually, there is a Blade Runner track at the end there, ignore that...
