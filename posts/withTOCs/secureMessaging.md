# Secure messaging

Here's an example secure messaging approach...

Generate a disposable chatroom - https://www.leapchat.org/

Encode and share the URL via: https://onetimesecret.com/

Use these services to share files securely:

- https://send.firefox.com/
- https://keybase.io/
- https://www.signal.org/
- https://telegram.org
