# Cheap goods
Order cheap goods from China using AliExpress.
Keep the AliExpress app on your phone at all times, order something as soon as you notice
you need it.
Prices are extraodinarily cheap, but delivery times can be ~2 months, try to think ahead. 

# Clothes
Penny's/Primark is the cheapest I've found anywhere.

# Expensive goods
It may be worth your while to buy a flight to a European/American city, and make your
expensive purchases there.
