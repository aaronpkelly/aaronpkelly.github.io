# Artist discovery and hosting
Absolutely love this site:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp

All sorts of indie artists live there.

# General
Spotify, it's fine for mainstream listening, but if you're an indie artist you
won't have a presence there. Bandcamp is great for that.

# Webradio
One of my favourite sites to listen to music online is SomaFM:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma.fm

I found them when reading about Defcon - SomaFM provide the music for one of
the chillout rooms at the event. I find myself usually listening to the least
popular stations, because they're more interesting to me.

There is also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di.fm which is decent, but more
mainstream
