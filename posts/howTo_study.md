# How to study

I originally wrote these tips in college for myself while studying for a
computer science degree. Maybe you'll find them useful!

# Stationary
##Paper
Use a lined foolscap pad with perforations at the top and punched holes in the 
side. Rip out and file at the end of term.

##Pencil
UCD offers unlimited pencils via the Maths Support Centre. You should be using 
pencils to annotate printouts and for revision. Pencils should be the main 
writing tool you use during your studies!

## Pens
Use a standard bic pen with 4 pen colours if you can. Here is how I use the 
colours:
Black: Default colour, used for writing definitions, answers to questions
Blue: Alternative colour, used for writing questions, or expressions/equations
Green: Used for informative tips around study notes or drawing diagrams
Red: The uber highlighting colour - used for marking out very important single 
words, or writing notes of caution, or underlining

## Binders and files
Put all your notes into A4 lever arch binders, individual swingclip or
expanding files. Any of these will do. Lever-arch files are my favourite.

In a swingclip file, user a paperclip to organise the different sections or 
lectures. Also, at the top of every paperclipped section should be a record 
card(s) that summaries the entire section. Take these out when it's exam times 
and WHAMMO you have the entire course condensed.

## Record cards
A new use! Instead of recording all course content, use a card to test a skill 
learnt during your course/stage so you don't forget it over time - put it in a 
box, and go through them regularly to stay sharp

I mentioned these earlier, and I'll mention these again. During your review 
time, try to boil away and reduce down your entire course into a collection of 
record cards. You now don't need to review many pages of notes, you have a 
portable collection of notes you can read anywhere.

Record card format:
	Definition type: Record card contains comprehensive detail on material
	Question type: Record card has questions on one side, and answers on the
other

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Accumulating study material
## Note taking
First off, try and take good legible notes. Imagine that all the notes you take
you will end up binding at the end of the semster and using as reference
material. If at all possible. Use a foolscap pad and the Cornell style of
notetaking. Use a big pad, write only on the one side of the page
(use the other side for working out if needed). You can use your notes to 
review, and make record cards of the important points that you need to remember.
I love marign notes. In the marigns of the page, write the number of the example
(Ex. 42, Thm 49, slide 47) in plain font, and for any extra margin notes slant
them diagonally so you can write more into the space.

## When to take notes
Some lecturers just read off slides, and do very little boardwork. Your time is
probably better served just following the lecture as closely as possible, maybe
jotting down major concepts or drawing diagrams that are shown. There's no point
in trying to capture everything if your missing out on focussing on what the 
lecturer is saying. During revision, you can go through the slides and take
appropriate notes on the different areas.
Some people make margin notes on their printouts of the course material while
following along with the lecture, this is a great idea too!

The other lecturers are the ones that do a lot of board work - take down
everything they say! Some may even advise you that everything they are doing is
up online anyway, but don't take this bait - the examples they are working
through on the day may be different, more helpful, more up-to-date, than what is
online. You can't have enough examples! 

## Doodling
It can be a help to follow on with the lecture with just a scrap piece of paper
and just doodle while following the class - it can add a sense of playfulness to
the class and help you visualise concepts.

# Electronic note-taking
I emphasise a more traditional notetaking system, but there's definitely an
advantage to using a text editor when you need to take down a lot of spoken
or written material quickly. If this is the case - use **markdown**. It's a 
format that you can write your text documents in that can quickly be
converted to .html or .pdf. 

If condensing a large amount of lecture notes into a single file, put a
summary of whats complete at the top of the file, so you know where to resume
next time.

If using *VIM* to take notes, there is an easy way to insert Unicode symbols
using *digraphs* - this is handy for equations. Look it up.

## For lecturers who do lots of board work
Take handwritten notes. You'll never be able to keep up if you're trying to
capture all the nuances of their boardwork.

## For lecturers who lecture mainly with slides and have minimal board work
If a lectures slides are available after class, concentrate on understanding the
material being presented, don’t worry about taking notes. Only takes notes o
 extra information that is presented in class, such as worked examples. After
class, view the slides and turn them into record cards.

## For lecturerers who read from the slides
Skip their classes and go make better use of your time. Seriously.



# Printing notes
If you take GOOD notes, which are legible, then go to the Copi-print shop and
get them professionally bound for EUR2.40. Love that bindiness.

# Essential tips for assignments
Make your own marking scheme, if the assignment doesn’t come with one. Use an
 excel document and keep track of the constraints you need to fulfill in order 
to ace it!
Use horizontal rules 
Use footnotes1 or footnotesa
Use comments
Use indentation for formulas or quotes - go read some style guides
Use paragraphs (ctrl+alt+1)
Use table of contents

# Learning journals
Start these early, and do them as soon as possible. Do not leave until the last 
minute!

# Keeping track of assignments and due dates
Use UCD Google calendar; create events on the due dates and colour them RED.
This is not task tracking. This only deals with major events.
Set reminders on dates so you get emailed when they are getting near. 
I have reminders set up that email me at the following times before a task is 
due: 2 weeks/1 weeks/3 days/1 day



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Starting to study
All of the below are techniques to get you studying and keep you there!

## Getting started / fear of starting
From https://jamesclear.com/akrasia:
- Design your future actions
- Reduce the friction of starting
- Utilize implementation intentions

## Unplug, get out of the house, and get into a study area
If you ever find yourself dawdling, distracted and aimless while using a device,
just switch it off. You'll just get bored, tired and waste time.
Laptops, phones and gadgets for the most part just distract you. Get out of the
house, go to a study area, switch off all your devices and just work with 
pencil, paper and your notes. Some libraries even have 'quiet zones' where 
electronic devices aren't allowed.

## It's all so quiet
Distractions, loud music, multiple tabs... these all work to pull your focus
away from what you're supposed to be doing. Get rid of them, and then take a 
minute to enjoy the silence, and the distraction-free environment you've
created. Soon, as your mind starts to crave stimuli, it will want to wander
to anything - including work!

Even if you have no idea where to get started with an assignment and dread 
having to tackle it, just start it - write anything. After writing a couple of 
sentence, the mental roadblock is removed from your mind, the fear leaves you 
and you can start chipping away at it!

## Breaking up tasks into chunks
If you get given an assignment with 15 questions due in by a certain day, work 
out how many questions you need to do each day. This breaks up the assignment 
into manageable portions

## Be specific about what your working on
Don't just say "Tonight I will just study maths". This is far to open ended and 
can lead to a feeling of hopelessness as you try to decide what to study. 
Instead, say to yourself "Tonight I will study vectors". 
This removes any vagueness and you are much more focussed on the material.

## Plan your study day
If you have no problems sticking to a schedule, plan your study day in Google 
Calendar into blocks of 50 minutes, with a 10 minute break each hour (similar 
to how current modules work in college). You must define a start and end time to
every session. If you leave your study session time open ended it can feel 
aimless, unending and unproductive. Having an end-time gives you something to 
work towards! 

## Hard copy 
Reading slides from a computer screen or tablet isn't ideal, especially if you 
have a lot of slides to go through. Print them out, 4 to a page, double-sided. 
This means you have a compact 8 slides per page, you'll be surprised how much 
your course material condenses down to!

## Start the e.ggtimer if you are having trouble studying
This is also called the 'pomodoro technique'. I use an eggtimer that gives an 
alarm after a set period. If you are doing a subject you hate, start the
eggtimer at 25 minutes, then take a short break when the time is up. 
I use http://e.ggtimer.com/. There is also a Chrome extension called "Pomodoro
Timer" that is very good.

## Randomise learning order
Don't stick to the same order of revision for each of your modules, stay
frosty by randomising the order in which you study your subjects every
day. Use a lottery system, or write a program to shuffle a list of modules and
print the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# During study
## How do you learn?
Your brain takes in information different from everyone else, try to recognise
what works best for you. Auditory, visual or kinesthetic? Find out what ratio
of these you are and make sure your study technique reflects it. I myself am a
visual and kinesthetic learner, so pinning items on a corkboard, then using
string and tape to bind material and diagrams together (very old-school
detective!) really helps get me involved in what I'm learning. 
Read the book 'A Mind for Numbers' for some great insight into this.

## Let's get digital
You can transform simple text files into slideshows (good for question and 
answer slides) using the linux tool mdp. You can make directed graphs using
the linux tool dot.

## How to use corkboards and whiteboards
It may be faster to print out a lecturer's notes and throw them up, rather than
rewriting everything by hand.
Sticking worked problems to the board is handy - they will be visible for quick
review and available for easy retrieval.

Put the board somewhere visible and in your near field of vision.

## Get in 'the zone'
There is a feeling that you can sometimes get by being so engrossed in your 
study that you enter a trance-like state. No joke. This is a good place to be! 
Aim for it.

##Impose meaning on the learning
Active learning - use problem based learning, imbed the principle in the 
problem, use everyday analogies.
For everything you learn, keep these three things in mind:
- What is it good for? (Greferath 2014)
- What does it buy for us? (McLoughlin 2014)
- How can I make this tastier? (Greferath 2014)

In my case, turning what I learn in class into pratical, working Java programs 
that solve real-world problems works well for me!

## Walk it off
I have found the easiest way for me to read through my mountain of textbooks is
to load them onto my kindle (mobi format) and read while walking! I stay
focused because of the exercise and I can pause and think about what i'm 
reading!

## You will fall off the wagon, so don't fret!
Just wipe the slate clean and start again, you can't be a study wunderkind all 
the time!

## Other
- You must leave the house to study!
- Get a laptop with a long battery life, during the day power points can be hard
to come by. You don't always have to charge to full however - if you come into 
college with a 50% charge and no charger, you will be forced to put away your 
laptop during lectures and pay more attention!
- Turn off your phone, disable WIFI
- Break your study sessions up into blocks of time - use the pomodoro technique
- Indent your paragraphs!
- Star your Google docs typed assignments so you dont have to hunt through 
folders to find them, its a one click button to have them all in the same
place and start working on them
- Method of loci

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task tracking
## The endless cycle
My current technique for studying my modules is a circular flow that visits
every module once for a 25 minute period and then I have a break. I keep
repeating this endlessly, although on successive passes I may do something diff-
erent - such as read a textbook or do the homework for a particular module.

## X marks the spot
After each study segment - say 25 minutes studying a topic - take some notes on
your current position, for example; where you read to in a textbook, how many
questions you answered on your homework etc. You will be able to track your 
progression much easier and will be able to jump back in to the right place
when your next study block for the course arrives. I use text files for
everything, so I just update them.

## Weave in assignments/worksheets
If you have a large assignment or homework - weave in the work you do on it in-
between your other 25-minute blocks. You won't get frustrated spending all your
time working on one piece of work and you will incrementally complete it in a 
much happier frame of mind.

## Work it
Enter the pencil, grab a pad or some scrap paper and start a 
stream-of-consciousness revision of all the material. Ideally keep a big 
revision logbook, and try to keep a record of your thoughts as you are working 
through problems. Keep your writing small and neat.

Working problems and questions is the best way to test your mastery of the 
subject. They can be found in textbook exercises, problem sheets, homework 
sheets etc. Also, you should be able to self-question and self-exam. You should
also have questions created on your record cards - these questions typically 
should be harder and should represent a test of the hardest of the subject 
areas material.

## Cover up
Test that you have mastery of a concept by covering up your notes on it and 
writing as much as you can about the concept itself, or even partially covering
up the solution steps to a problem and uncovering the steps one at a time as you
work through the problem. This forces you to think about how the solution was 
solved step by step, not just seeing the whole solution in one go. You can use a
ruler!

## Pad that
Once I have fully grasped a problem or concept, I dedicate a page or two of a 
legal pad to describing the concept or the working out steps very clearly and
neatly. In some cases, it will be better explained than the lecturers own notes!
If I ever need to revise it I can just flip back to it. It describes the problem
in my own words and in a way that plays nice with my brain. Mark sections with
sticky page markers, and store them safely in an A4 binder.

## Textual healing
Nothing beats a good textbook. The internet is a great resouce but it can be
frustrating to find good sensible information on a topic in a clear manner. 
Get a pdf/epub/mobi of a good textbook and start reading. I have a basic kindle
with all my college textbooks loaded onto it, which makes reading easy and fun.

## Todo lists
A todo list can be useful. I've started using a command line application called
todo. It works great. Set priorities and keep it up-to-date.

## Get ahead of the class
If you think you’ve finished everything, you have't. At the very least, try
to get ahead of the class

## Start working old midterms/exams straight away
A controversial suggestion, but if you can get familiar with what you are
expected to know, then you'll pay attention in class when these topics turn up

## Work it
Enter the pencil, grab a pad or some scrap paper and start a
stream-of-consciousness revision of all the material. Ideally keep a big
revision logbook, and try to keep a record of your thoughts as you are working
through problems. Keep your writing small and neat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Preparing for exams
## The War Room
This is a technique I created that appeals to me, as you get a good sense of
progression out of it and most importantly, it's fun! Before every set of exams
I create an excel sheet that keeps track of what I still need to cover before an
exam, and what I have already covered. I use a tab for each module, and in each
tab I have sections for course notes, tutorial sheets and past exams. Next to
each entry I have a link to each document for easy access. 
What I do next is colour code each row, starting with a dark colour. As I revise
more and more, the speadsheet begins to brighten up - like exploring a dungeon!
This makes it easy for me to see at a glance how much of the course I've
revised.

## Do a trial exam first
This will give you a sense of what will be asked in a typical exam, and should
help to guide you on what to revise.

## Revision
Enter the pencil, grab a pad or some scrap paper and start a 
stream-of-consciousness revision of all the material. Ideally keep a big
revision logbook, and try to keep a record of your thoughts as you are working 
through problems. Keep your writing small and neat

Working problems and questions is the best way to test your mastery of the 
subject. They can be found in textbook exercises, problem sheets, homework 
sheets etc. Also, you should be able to self-question and self-exam. You should
also have questions created on your record cards - these questions typically
should be harder and should represent a test of the hardest of the subject
area's material.

### Spaced repetition

### Create concise summaries of materials
Read a page and then reduce it to a paragraphs

### Create outlines of a course
Take a high level view of the course material and summarie it in broad
strokes/bullet points
