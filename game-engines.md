# Awesome links

These links are pretty fab, gives a breakdown of most used tools, engines, software etc. used by devs that publish to itch.io:

I also really liked [this post](https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74) I found on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22965078) that gives a breakdown of development studio size, and whether they decided to use a game engine or develop their own.

# Some game engines I'd love to try

##  Godot

It looks great, and it's really popular

## Unity

There's a Linux version - great. Here's [the announcement](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/30/announcing-the-unity-editor-for-linux/), and here's [a forum for it](https://forum.unity.com/forums/linux-editor.93/).

Also, there's something called a 'Unity Hub' I must download in order to download the actual program: https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-hub-v2-0-0-release.677485/

This file is an 'AppImage', which I've never really come across before, more info [here](https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/). All I need to do to run it is make it executable:

```
$ ./UnityHub.AppImage 
License accepted
Checking for update
Generated new staging user ID: 4457cd9b-b9e4-53c4-b1ce-eb35c43b92d0
Checking for update (already in progress)
Update for version 2.3.0 is not available (latest version: 2.3.0, downgrade is disallowed).
```

I have to say, the Unity AppImage is pretty slick.

However, in order to start actually _using_ the software, what I found weird is that I needed to first manually generate a licence inside their Unity Hub appImage in order to even start using the software, which was a bit frustrating. But after a bit of back and forth between the Unity Hub, a web browser, the 'personal' licence was applied to Unity Hub and I was finally able to start downloading the Unity editor. Fun times. I'm going to leave it downloading overnight and come back to it in the morning.
