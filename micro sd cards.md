# cannot write to card?
> Micro SD cards work on Flash NAND memory, which becomes read-only after a certain number of program-erase cycles. A program erase cycle is simply overwriting/deleting the data in a NAND cell. Most memory cards last 3-10000 cycles, after which they become read-only because it's not possible to erase information in the cells anymore,
> In short, you can't fix it. Sorry.

# using an adapter to flip the "lock" on the smaller micro sd card
haven't tried it, but it was suggested. don't think it will work
