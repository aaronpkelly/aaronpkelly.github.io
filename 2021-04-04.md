nice easter day at Conor and Ciara's
got stopped in a Gardai checkpoint on the way there, pointed to the plant trays in the back seat of our GoCar and said we had rented a polytunnel - didn't ask where we were from or where we were going - young Gardai waved us on!
helped make a frame for the peas in the polytunnel
kids had an easter egg hunt, 8 clues each
