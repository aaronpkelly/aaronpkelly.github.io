# Coming up with industry specific ideas applications
Go to an industry, ask what they have problems with, build an app to help them

# College
UCD Lights
A map of UCD which shows little lights that dim as the buildings get closer to closing

# Lifestyle
Big bookmark
I constantly am reading items on webpages, PDF files, and many other formats and I lose my place constantly because they either lack a way to bookmark the location or you are moving between so many different devices you cannot sync your bookmarking.

The big bookmark is a way to sync your place in all formats across all devices

Glasses/lenses that dim light
Some people have trouble getting to sleep because they have bright glaring screens right into late at night. Special glasses/lenses would start dimming at a preset time (mimicing sunset?), and would become very dark for the evening. This should hopefully make you want to go to bed earlier. Like sunglasses I suppose :)
But more gradual and hopefully unnoticable
Travel industry
A phone translation service
Say your in a taxi, and in Turkey, however your taxi driver can't understand you, or you want to communicate something special but can't - you can call a number, and they will have an operator that will take your call, and either have a phrase SMS'd, emailed or will even speak with the person in question
An airport time tracker
Plug in what time your plane is due to leave and it wakes you up, gives you time for breakfast, reminds you of last minute details, tells you when you should take a cab, proceed through security and to your gate

Maths
Imagine you start with a number. The number is like your hero. You solve a super basic maths question and the number drops off the page into a another page where the calculation is slightly harder.

You follow the number's journey through arithmetic all the way to advanced calculus, and you see how maths works along the way. Things get harder and harder and each time you solve the question it links into the next one by some conveyance - you never lose your number, you follow your number to the end. The number is your hero

# Apps
I want apps to reward people to stop using their phone, or features on their
phone!

## Bloom
The longer you go without looking at any of your social media notifications,
the bigger a bloom of fractal flowers that appears on your screen. You can add
this to a garden/forest

## Android look up game
People are constantly looking down at their phones when on trains/busses. Make a game where their location is pinpointed, it searches for ppl playing the game near you and for some reason you have to look up and scan around you to find another person playing and you can help each other by like.. nodding or smiling at each other and then you both know when to make a move at the same time. Something like that.
Maths
Sound maths
Maths using sound to explain concepts using sound. For example sine functions - when plotting functions, x is constant but Y is changing. The pitch should go up and down as Y rises and alls. Also, if finding roots for an equation, a root can make a THUD sound as it hits the x axis. 
An exponential function can be audiolized(?) very easily because it rises in pitch so fast.
In this way, a function can be visualised not by drawing, but by sound alone. Maybe more math concepts can be explained using sound. 
Eg. explaining sets of numbers, like 22, every element would be represented by a pulse, so you would see how squaring a number doubles all the elements each time.
