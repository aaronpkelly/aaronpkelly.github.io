# aphids
## preventing
- spray plants with hortocultural/essential oils (peppermint)
- companion planting.
aphids hate (to repel): catnip, alliums (garlic, chives...)
aphids love (to trap): mustard, nasturtium, collards
- introduce beneficial insects - ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps

### beneficial insects
Attract them with:
    Marigolds
    Caraway
    Chives
    Cosmos
    Fennel
    Dill
    Sweet Alyssum


## curing
- squish them with your fingers
- wipe them off the plant
- blast them off a plant with strong jet of water

- dehydrate them with a mild solution of water and dish/insecticidal soap
- repel them with repugnant hortocultural oils

- constipate them by dusting the plant with flour
- suffocate them with 100% cold-pressed neem oil. This oil is very effective
- ground them with diotomaceous earth

## insecticidal sprays and soaps
Sprays may leave a residue that may damage other beneficial insects
Soaps won't leave a residue. They must be applied directly to the
insects

- Dish soap: a soapy emulsion of 5 cups water, 1 tblspoon dish soap
- Cayenne soap: One variation of the soap-water mix includes cayenne pepper.
Stir together 1 quart water, 1 tsp liquid dish soap, and a pinch of cayenne
pepper. Do not dilute before spraying on plants.
- Alcohol: a mix of equal parts 70 percent grain alcohol and water
- Insecticidal soap, made from potassium salt of fatty acids, works by penetrating
and destroying the outer shell or membrane of the insect causing it to dehydrate
and die
