To read
Definitely do the reading yourself rather than paying money for others to teach you. The books I would consider reading are;

Reminisces of a Stock Operator
Market Wizards
The New Market Wizards
Random Walk Down Wall St.
Alexander Elder's "Trading for a Living" is also worth a read, particularly if you trade using technical analysis.

The last book heavily argues against frequent trading and theorises that buy and hold leads to greater investments. None the less it has good ideas in it and can at least point out some of the pitfalls other investors have.

To summarise key points from the 3 books.
"Sit tight and be right" - Reminisces of a Stock Operator
- If you have a winner and it is indeed still going your way then don't be content with just taking your winnings, stay with it. It is all too easy for emotions to get the better of you and for you to just take your quick profit.

"Losers Average Losers" - Market Wizards
- You will often come across people who if they are long of a position and it goes against them will increase their position even more, thus averaging out their loss or they might still see it as a bargain. In a lot of instances (majority in my opinion) its just throw good money after bad. What you will see less of is when their position is in their favour people increasing their position. As such I agree with their statement that losers average losers and winners average winners. Also despite what some people say, there is no such thing as a paper loss.

Just remember though, I think it is only 1 in 5 of people involved with Spread Betting actually make a profit. From talking to my friend that works in IG Index it seems even less. As far as I understand, the reason its not taxed is because so many people lose they could use their losses as tax deductables and there would be lost revenue to the exchequer.
