Rivet Networks presents the Killer Wireless-AC 1535: an M.2 2230 adapter, which supports the
802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards and Bluetooth 4.1.
The card is based on a Qualcomm chip, but its software and hardware design and certifications are from Rivet Networks.
This chip is a dual-band (2.4 and 5 GHz) 2x2 AC WLAN adapter, which supports MU-MIMO and Beamforming.
Rivet has added features, such as Advanced Stream Detect for Quality of Service and ExtremeRange for extended range.
Combined with a LAN chip from Killer, this card allows the user to employ WLAN and LAN simultaneously and intelligently for QoS.
Rivet calls this combo the DoubleShot Pro technology.
