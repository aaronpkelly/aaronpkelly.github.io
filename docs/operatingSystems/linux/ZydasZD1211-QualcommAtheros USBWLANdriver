# debian
debian just doesn't come with the necessary drivers built-in. this causes
problems during the **network** install, and even the full DVD install. it 
just doesn't include them.

## network install requiring zd1211 drivers
the file you need is called zd1211-firmware_3.0.0.56.orig.tar.gz.

the above tar file needs to be uncompressed and the files available to the
installation process. it will then be able to load the driver and connect
to a wifi point

# Gentoo
install the linux-firmware package

make sure your wifi firmware drivers are loaded as a module in your kernel
        make menuconfig

Then build your kernel
        sudo make && sudo make modules_install && sudo make install

The below command is not recommended by the forum peeps, but I ran it once in desperation and I could see my firmware being loaded in to the kernel (I can’t tell if this is what helped me fix my wifi or not...
        make && make firmware_install 

install wpa_supplicant

I then used this technique (ty arch linux!) to get my wifi to connect
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant#Connecting_with_wpa_passphrase

dhcpcd
I've had problems with my router not assigning me an ip address properly. Stop/start the dhcpcd daemon
        sudo /etc/init.d/dhcpcd {stop, start}

# raspberry pi
The firmware on the raspbian image for the zd1211rw driver won’t work. A similar problem is show here:
http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=41755

Download the new firmware and follow the install instructions:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zd1211/files/zd1211-firmware/

You should now be able to follow the wpa_supplicant configuration as per the Gentoo section

# Windows 10
`athrxusb.sys` is the official file that windows 10 needs in order to 
recognise the device.

```
Driver Description: Atheros Wireless LAN USB device driver
Driver Update Site: Official site (no longer supported!): http://www.qualcomm.com/drivers
Unofficial site: http://www.driverguide.com/driver/detail.php?driverid=1627725&action=filfo
```

## old instructions (using the driver for windows 7 - contains useful info about disabling driver signing)

use the same driver as for windows 7 - it's a tp-link one, but it allows you
to get connected at least. however first - you need to disable device driver
signing before windows will install the fucking thing.

    Select the “Start” button.
    Type “startup”.
    Select “Change advanced startup settings“.
    Select “Restart now” under the “Advanced startup” area.
    Select “Troubleshoot“.
    Select “Advanced Options“.
    Select “Startup Options“.
    Select “Restart“.
    A menu will appear where you can press “7” on your keyboard to choose “Disable driver signing enforcement“.

Now Device Driver Signing should be disabled, allowing you to install any driver you like in Windows 10 until you reboot.
once connected to wifi, update the driver using windows. it should download an Atheros `athrxusb.sys` file.

# Windows 7
If windows does not have a native driver, you may need to go here in the interim:
http://www.driverscape.com/download/zydas-zd1211-802.11-b%2Bg-wireless-lan

click the 2nd or 3rd download button! the first one downloads some trash .exe file

Use device manager to install, you can’t install directly from the .inf

Afterwards, windows update should show that an optional driver is available. Install that:
Atheros Communications Inc. - Network - Atheros AR5007UG Wireless Network Adapter
Installation date: ‎03/‎01/‎2015 19:29
Installation status: Successful
Update type: Optional
Atheros Communications Inc. Network software update released in July, 2008
