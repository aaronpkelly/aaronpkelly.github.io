# accessing containers that are serving web pages
even if a container is saying that a webpage is available on 0.0.0.0:4000,
this doesn't mean that the container is visible at this IP address on the
host machine.

you need to find the correct IP:PORT to connect to from the host machine.

## from the host machine
`ip addr show docker0`

will show you the range of ip addresses that docker can potentially serve on.

## within the docker container
`ip route show` will display the IP address of the container as seen by the
host machine. the address after the `src` text is the address that should be
connected to
