The below steps are for Kali linux but I'm sure they can be used for Chrubuntu etc

Before starting
I've had much more success with using SD cards rather than flash drives.

After the dd operation, I am able to see partitions on an SD card, but a flash drive I cannot.

Make sure the USB/flash disk is properly formatted (use fdisk or gparted) and you make a GPT partition table. Also I don't know if you should make a file system. Probably not? ?

Make sure the laptop has developer mode drivers installed
chronos@localhost $ chronos
chronos@localhost $ sudo bash
localhost chronos # chromeos-firmwareupdate --mode=todev
reboot
Flash Drive / SD card
Unmount the flash drive before writing anything to it! Click the unmount button in the file manager
Copy to flash drive
dd if=kali-chromebook.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512k

As soon as the dd operation finishes, you should see partitions

Repair flash drive
$ sudo cgpt repair /dev/sda
Set priority of boot partitions
Make sure that you are choosing the correct partiion (-i)
$ sudo cgpt add -i 1 -T 5 -P 5 -l KERN-A /dev/sda
$ sudo cgpt add -i 2 -T 5 -P 10 -l KERN-B /dev/sda
Check priorities were applied flash drive
$ sudo cgpt show /dev/sda
Make sure usb boot is enabled
sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1
SD card
Rebooting while dd'ing?
