# video
## third party proprietary drivers
if you missed installing these when mint was first being installed, then just
go to sound & video -> install multimedia codecs

## steam + nvidia
steam won't run without good video drivers. it doesn't seem to want to accept
nouveau. 

just install the proprietary nvidia ones
