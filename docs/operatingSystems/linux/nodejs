on the pi, you have to build from source, howevere there are a number of
things you need to configure if you are building it on a pi, as theer is
a problem with detecting the correct processor (it will detect armv7 instead
of armv6).

see this page http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/24059/node-js-v0-11-14-exits-with-illegal-instruction

then run these commands to install packages using the npm package manager:
npm set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
sudo npm install castnow -g
