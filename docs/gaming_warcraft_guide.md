# significant levels
| 98  | artefact weapon unlock |
| 101 | class campaign unlock 1 (dalaran) |
| 102 | artefac weapon additional unlocks |
| 103 | class campaign unlock 2 (class order hall) |

# dont get world artefact treasures until your 110
they are worth much more when you're higher

# get legion assaults
a 110 character must unlock them for alts.
to do this i need to unlock world quests.
to do this i need to get _friendly_ with a bunch of factions

# flying
requires revered with a number of factions. harder.
i can use all my alts to work toward this achievement, will unlock
flying for all.
below are all the sub achievements i need to earn and my progress

## broken isles pathfinder part 1
### broken isles explorer + loremaster of legion + broken isles diplomat
these three achievements i can do together.

broken isles explorer: explorer the whole zone
loremaster of legion: complete all major zone quests
broken isles diplomat: earn rep with the zone faction

| *zone* | | *dungeon* | *factions* | *class responsible* |
| aszuna | eyeOfAshzarah | courtOfFarondis | warlock |
| stormheim | mawOfSouls+hallsOfValour | valarjar | shaman |
| suramar(110 zone) | none |  nightfallen | demonHunter |
| val'sharah | darkheartThicket | dreamweavers | mage |
| highmountain | neltharionsLair | highmountainTribe | priest |

### variety is the spice of life
can't start until i get access to world quests (becoming friendly with main factions in different zones)

### a glorious campaign
i will complete the demon hunter campaign

## broken isles pathfinder part 2
### legionfall commander
earn revered with armies of legionfall. who are they? 
### explore broken shore

# Talents
Don't just rely on Noxxic, those talents are for raids, and there may be talents
that can help you level faster.

# Heirlooms
Timewarped badges and Darkmoon Faire tickets can be used to purchase heriloom
gear.
Look at the calendar and aim to earn as much as this currency as possible during
the time window.

# XP buffs
## Potion of Accelerated Learning
Easy to get, +20% XP buff.
Costs 100 garrison resources to buy this potion from your garrison quartermaster.
You should aim to have this buff active when questing/dungeoning in Draenor at all times.
Make doubly sure that the buff is active when:
- you're turning in quests
- you're doing World Quests

## Heirloom items
Gear that scales with you as you level. All heirloom items now work up to lvl 110.
Gold can be used to buy heirlooms and heirloom armour upgrade tokens, but it's expensive - 5K a pop.

The following world events reward special tokens that can go towards purchasing some heirloom gear. They are easy to get:
- Timewalking (Timewarped Badge)
- Darkmoon Faire (Darkmoon Prize Ticket)
- Midsummer Fire Festival (Burning Blossoms)

Look at the calendar and aim to earn as much as this currency as possible during the time window.
The rewards from the events can be traded in to special vendors.

## Timewarped Badges
The first timewarped dungeon completed during the event awards a special quest
that gives 500 timewarped badges when turning in.
The turn-in location is *OLD DALARAN*, not new Dalaran. You'll need to catch
a ship from Stormwind to Borean Tundra, or a portal from new Dalaran to
Wyrmrest temple, and then fly.

## Darkmoon Prize Tickts
There are a few breadcrumb quests linked to the Darkmoon Faire, turning them in starts you off
with a good amount of Darkmoon Faire

## Heirloom rings
You need a lvl3 Garrison to start a Shipyard, from which a rare quest can be found
to purchase heirloom rings. Hard to get.

The monk has a lvl3 garrison.
Get ur monk to do the shipyard quests at lvl 100 so you can get the
heirloom rings.

# class order halls
## get high-level weapons cheaply
your class hall quartermaster sells high-level weapons for cheap gold. get one for all your specs,
while you're getting your legendaries

# Addons useful for XP
## Handynotes
Giant gobs of XP can be earned in Draenor by finding treasures on the world map (not so much in Legion).
Install "HandyNotes Draenor+Legion" to put treasure locations on your map.

# Level 98 yet?
Leave Draenor as soon as you reach lvl 98.
How? A quest will be offered to you to go to new Dalaran (quest will be offered at your Garrisson, or in Stormwind). 
Do it, go there. What's being offered to you is the start of the Legion expansion.
You'll be invited to go to your class hall, go there.
Follow a class hall quest to get your free iLvl 750 artefact weapon. Yes.
Enjoy questing through the Legion expansion at lvl 98 with your shiny new legendary weapon.
