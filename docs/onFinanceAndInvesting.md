# Bank accounts
Get an account that charges no fees. In Ireland there is the EBS MoneyManager
account.
Also, if you get a Revolut card, you essentially have a UK bank account.






















# Investing
## First up..
## AER is your friend
Annual equivalent rate is the interest rate calculated for your investment per
annum

## Read the KID/KIID document for your potential investment
Every ETF or investment product has a KID/KIID document (Key (Investor)
Information Document).

Before investing you should read about the fund. Every KID document is layed out
in a standard format, and should show you information like the fund risk etc.

## Risk and your tolerence to it
A lot of investment decisions should be based around your personal tolerence
to risk. What level of risk you can tolerate and still get a good nights
sleep? If your savings fund drops 5% overnight, will that cause your concern?
How about 10%?

## Bonds

## Shares/stocks
### Direct investing
Not enough xp to talk about this yet. Barefoot guy recommends investing directly
in about 10 good companies though.

### Index funds
#### Which ones to choose?
General advice: A very broad global index fund with fees below 0.2%; it's what 95% of the population should invest in if anything.

## ETFs
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks
ET = "exchange-traded"
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.
F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.
If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.### Commission free ETF orders on Degiro

### Accumulating
Keep an eye out for Use of Profits: Accumulating. Much better than distributing, as it allows better compound interest.

### Taxation on ETFs in ireland
the tax treatment for US and EU domiciled ETFs here in Ireland is quite different.

EU ETFs and mutual funds have "deemed disposal" after 8 years where the government will tax you as if you had sold them and realised the gains. Need to keep track of all the tranches you have bought and when, and losses on one tranche cannot be offset against gains on another. Really way too onerous system - wish the revenue/govt would sort it out.
US ETFs are taxed normally i.e. you buy them and then pay the CGT when you sell them. Only problem is there is a new EU rule this year requiring some additional documentation before they can be sold through a broker here in Europe, like Degiro, which means we can't buy them until they comply with it. No-one seems to know when they will be likely to be available again.

Irish taxes on funds and european domiciled etfs are kind of onerous (there is a very annoying rule about deemed disposal after 8 years) so a lot of people have been buying the US etfs which are simpler to deal with tax-wise. Since 1st Jan however it is impossible to buy US domiciled etfs as they have yet to produce some documentation for new European regulations.

Tax treatment of ETFs. US domiciled seem to make the most sense.

### My picks
FRCL/GB0003466074

## Non-divedend paying shares
Invest directly in shares which don’t pay a Dividend. You’ll only pay 33% Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make when you sell those shares. If you invest in a Dividend paying share you could lose more than half of the dividend as you must pay income tax at your higher rate of tax, as well as the USC and PRSI. Higher-rate taxpayers who move their savings into dividend-paying shares in a bid to avoid DIRT may sometimes end up paying more tax on their dividend income than they did on their savings interest.

# Capital gains tax
Every individual has an annual CGT exemption of €1,270 (€2,540 for a couple), this means that the first €1,270 or €2,540 of interest you earn each year is Tax free

# Ripoffs?
investment product offered by any Irish life assurance company

# Selling shares - what tax do I pay?
You'll pay PAYE, PRSI and USC on their market value when they are vested and then when you sell them you'll pay CGT on the profit you make between the market value when they vested and when you sold them

## Tax free investments
### Forestry
Returns from investing in forestry are tax free up to €125,000
Locked into the forestry fund for at least 12 years
Returns 5pc to 7pc, net inflation

Be careful about some forestry websites, ppl haven't gotten payments, and some














# Pensions
The power of investing in pension is tax relief, and lots of it.

Invest more money in your pension. You may not like to hear it but it make
sense. All Income and capital gains within a pension fund are completely tax
free, and the compounding effect of tax-free growth over time is very powerful.

In Addition, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you also get 40% tax relief on
any contributions paid into a pension, subject to certain limits. It’s a
no-brainer really.


## ARF
Annualised retirement fund, don't know much about these

## Tax
Entitled to a tax-free lump sum of 25 per cent of your pension on retirement.
Apparently there is a danger of  paying tax at a rate of 52 per cent on the
fund, but I don't know what will cause this.

Percentage of allowable tax relief on pension savings: 40 per cent.

## Strategy
### Accumulation phase
Contribute to your pension up to the maximum amount that is tax-free and matched
by your employer. It's free money.

Build up your pension pot in separate funds. If you just have one fund, it will
all get retired at the same time. Try to retire on a single fund, work
3-days a week with the 25% tax-free sum from this fund, and keep the other
funds going.

If you’re self-employed for example, you can avail of different pension structures, such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) etc,

If you’re employed, but have worked in various places and thus have built
up several occupational schemes, leave these alone in retirement bonds.

## Retirement
At retirement, you can take 25% of your pension fund out as a lump sum, up to
EUR200,000. The remaining balance is then used as your pension.
Your pension income will be assessable by tax.

## Self employed
If you’re self-employed, you can still contribute to a pension fund.
However, be careful of charges - there can be annual charges (1%) and charges
on each contribution (5%). Aim to get better than that.

You can also avail of different pension  structures, such as retirement
annuity contracts (RACs) etc.



## PRSA
Personal Retirement Saving Accounts (PRSAs) are flexible, portable,
low-cost, transparent pensions. Anyone can take out a PRSA regardless
of employment status. You and your employer, if any, can make tax-free
contributions to it, you can take it with you if you change your job or
employment status, and you can stop and start making contributions at
any time

## stop loss
> if I am buying a share @ say $2.70 and want to minimise losses - what type of order do I input. Say if the price is falling and I want to set it to sell @ $2.60
To minimise losses: use Sell Option; Order Type : Stop Loss and enter price [$2.60].

## Limit order
> Also when selling if a share is at $3.00 and I want to take a profit at a minimum of $2.90 - can I set up an order so that the position I hold will be automatically sold once the share price hits $2.90

To take profit @ $2.90: use Sell; Order Type : Limit Order & enter price $2.90



















# Acronyms
## RSU
Restricted stock unit. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are issued to an employee through a vesting plan and distribution schedule after achieving required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. RSUs give an employee interest in company stock but have no tangible value until vesting is complete. The restricted stock units are assigned a fair market value when they vest. Upon vesting, they are considered income, and a portion of the shares are withheld to pay income taxes. The employee receives the remaining shares and can sell them at their discretion.

# reading material
To read
Definitely do the reading yourself rather than paying money for others to teach you. The books I would consider reading are;

Reminisces of a Stock Operator
Market Wizards
The New Market Wizards
Random Walk Down Wall St.
Alexander Elder's "Trading for a Living" is also worth a read, particularly if you trade using technical analysis.

The last book heavily argues against frequent trading and theorises that buy and hold leads to greater investments. None the less it has good ideas in it and can at least point out some of the pitfalls other investors have.

To summarise key points from the 3 books.
"Sit tight and be right" - Reminisces of a Stock Operator
- If you have a winner and it is indeed still going your way then don't be content with just taking your winnings, stay with it. It is all too easy for emotions to get the better of you and for you to just take your quick profit.

"Losers Average Losers" - Market Wizards
- You will often come across people who if they are long of a position and it goes against them will increase their position even more, thus averaging out their loss or they might still see it as a bargain. In a lot of instances (majority in my opinion) its just throw good money after bad. What you will see less of is when their position is in their favour people increasing their position. As such I agree with their statement that losers average losers and winners average winners. Also despite what some people say, there is no such thing as a paper loss.

Just remember though, I think it is only 1 in 5 of people involved with Spread Betting actually make a profit. From talking to my friend that works in IG Index it seems even less. As far as I understand, the reason its not taxed is because so many people lose they could use their losses as tax deductables and there would be lost revenue to the exchequer.
