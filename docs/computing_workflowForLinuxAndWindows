# Quick-start
- Manjaro I3 live usb
- get bootstrap environment - "export USER=aaronpkelly PASS=$GITHUB_PASS && git clone https://$USER:$PASS@github.com/$USER/secrets"
- ./startup_manjaro.sh
- develop locally or on gitpod
- connect to and build on Jenkins that's running on cloud/pi (if necessary, run locally)

# High-level goals
## Operating system environment
Destroy after every session.
Work from a live-USB environment (e.g. Majaro I3) to force yourself to
constantly improve and iterate on your environment.

## CI/CD
Have a Jenkins docker instance available and running somewhere, ideally.

## Persistence (Git)
Git functions as a persistent data store. Work inside git as much as possible.
Git is your source of truth.

## IDEs
### Cloud
#### Amazon Cloud 9
This is an amazing online IDE that basically turns an Amazon EC2 instance into
a fully-fledged online workstation. Edit docs, run code, start containers etc.
all from your browser.

## Containerisation (docker)
Run everything inside a container. Don't install anything. Redirect audio
and video from inside the container to your host devices.
