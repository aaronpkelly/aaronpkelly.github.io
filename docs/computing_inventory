## port forwarding
You can use port forwarding on the router to forward a high port number to the ssh port of a
pi on my local network.

e.g. 80.111.144.159:10000 -> 192.168.1.100:22

to generate this high port number, you can multiply the final octet of the local static ip address by the power of 2

e.g. if the local 192.168.1.100, the port number used for forwarding will be:
100^2 = 10000

# tape drives
name: coloradoTrakker250_tapeDrive
manufacturer: HP

## resources
##ftape program
[http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ftape-HOWTO.html]()

### man page
should be a man page, or the `tar` man page should have some info about working with tape drives

# laptops
## Acer Aspire 5810T series, model: MS2272
### Power
Input: 19V,3.42A
Fucking thing won't turn on
I have the exact power supply and all (the "HIPRO" one)


## Archos 10 netbook
### Power
Input: 20V, 2.0A
Push the Delta Electronics connector as hard as you can inside the port, if its
loose it'll power off.

### Networking
Has onboard WIFI, ethernet

### What's installed
Alpine Linux x86
Docker!

## compaq evo n610c
Persist. Turning on this laptop can be a bastard.
Removing the battery and then replacing it makes no difference.
It seems like the orientation of the power supply plug at 90 degrees makes the
most differenc.

Also, there's like some sleep sliding button on the top right which seems to have some effect on
getting the laptop to boot up. May be a red herring though.

## Power supply
Input: 18.5V, 2.7A

Use the Delta Electroncis one (19V, 4.74A), verified working. Takes a lot of
messing around with the cable though.

## What's installed
Alpine Linux x86
I think I forgot to install Docker, sorry. Refer to Alpine wiki for docker install

## network
ethernet only, as far as I can tell
