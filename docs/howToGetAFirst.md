# submitting assignments
Format your documents with Latex, if possible. Either use a latex editor, or use
Google Docs. Submitting nicely formatted, clean assignments means you will put a
lot of care and attention into what you are submitting.

# keep track of assignments
Keeping up with assignments can be a big task. Knowing exactly where you are
with your assignments is important, and being able to jump back in at a moments
notice and continue working is, for me, essential. This allows you to waste no
time 'ramping up', and removes the mental block of needing to work on them. I
keep linux screen sessions open for all my courses, and I will tailor them so 
that my current assignment is always open at exactly where I left off. This
means I can leave my current problem, go away and think about it, and come back
and finish it off.

I just finished my degree with a 1st and my advice would be;
- Attend all lecturers and tutorials no matter what. Your notes may already be on blackboard, but you're much more likely to remember something and gain a deeper
understanding of the subject through attendance. This is also where you get tips for exams.
- Have clearly written notes and do your own research on a weekly basis. For me this was reading articles on jstor, taking a few books out of the library and
simply researching online. Don't leave it until exams/assignments to know what's going on in your course.
- if you have a chance to pick electives, by all means choose those which interest you. However, also be realistic in terms of what they will do to your GPA. If
you want to experiment with something difficult, do it in your own time.
- talk to your lecturers and tutors on a regular basis. Ask for reading suggestions and don't be afraid to chance your arm. Do this in person, not via email. Not
only is this important in terms of getting references later, but oftentimes they will steer you in the right direction for your assignments and give you some
really good pointers without even meaning to.
Good luck!

I got firsts in every single module last semester using 'The Journey Method'. http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTIM_05.htm
Combine that with the techniques suggested by Dominic O'Brien (7 times world memory champion) in his book 'How to Pass Exams', and I promise you that you will
effortlessly remember every minute detail that you need, and studying becomes REALLY fun. Really
Being relaxed and knowing that you can remember all the details (precision is an element of achieving 1;1's) allows you more time to develop your analysis or
opinion, or to appropriately and precisely apply principles.
Best of luck, I hope it works out for you - at least you are motivated enough to do something about it, despite being disappointed! That motivation will stand to
you

attend all lectures, and spead to lecturers personally - they will let slip things that will come up on the exam

   well folks, just an update...... got my first !!!! to all those who gave such valuable insights regrading my "crusade" I am very thankful. Too those who may be
   striving for same , I would advise that ,
   1. Supplementary reading to your particular course outline is of paramount importance. I ensured I read/understood the nuances and counter viewpoints to the
   established line of thinking and thus could offer a hopefully original or deep appreciation of the work. Articles, journals, papers etc are crucial. This is time
   consuming of course but try and read at least three/four articles etc per each different topic in the particular module.
   2. Be surgically precise on your mode of answering the exam question. Waffle and padding does you no favours, it merely shows lack of awareness and ability to
   identify what the examiner requires. Less can be more, by doing this I wrote far less in exams than previously, which allowed for valuable time to reflect and
   write with decisive direction.
   3. View previous exam scripts. The examiner notes on your paper are insightful and you will both see where you may be falling short and also appreciate whether
   you writing style, grammar, ease of reading etc during exams, needs to be improved.
   4. Study prep. Ensure your lecture notes are arranged suitably , accompanied by your supplementary notes, etc, and devise a time scale per each module. Break
   your study periods into "bite sized" portions and keep a study diary, noting dates, time studied, subjects etc. . This allows you to actually see your progress
   as you study. This is psychologically important as studying the entire semester modules before exams can seem very daunting from scratch. Study should begin
   immediately!
   5. Assignments must be started at the earliest opportunity. Do not procrastinate !!! This is vital so that they do not become a millstone and source of worry
   when you should be focusing on the upcoming exams. Proof read repeatedly and leave your finished rough draft for a week or so before you return to it with a
   fresh perspective. You will spot inconsistencies , errors etc, immediately. Wait untill the day before the assignment submission date before actually submit it
   even if you have completed it weeks ago, as new developments, insights etc may arise in the intervening period. However, do not obsess with it. Do it and put it
   aside.
   I hope this may be of some assistance, it worked for me anyway. I am in no way an academic or particularly brilliant student but was prepared to work hard in a
   structured fashion. Now, I await the FE1s.........
