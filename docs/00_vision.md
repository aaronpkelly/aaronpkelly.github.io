- create value from everything
- why is a doc in a private repo? expose it. move all docs from private repos into my website
- try to monetize some good ideas
- keep the number of repos in your ~environment to a minumum, to eliminate task switching
- one repo should be directly mapped to one project/idea. everything else should be considered a publically viewable doc

all development projects should have their own markdown file, or if they are an
incubating idea, be listed in _myProjects.md_.
all writing about specific topics should be in their own named markdown file
any general writing should be in a file prefixed with _on*_, e.g. *onFinance.md*
