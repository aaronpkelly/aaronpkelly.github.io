## Week 2:
- Farmstead (The Color of Madness DLC): Exclusive to The Color of Madness DLC. Farmstead contains 3 quests in total and has it's own unique gameplay mechanics resulting in light meter changing it's own colors and endless waves of enemies. Just like in courtyard light meter does not drop here. Farmstead does not even have corridors.
## Week 3:
- Warrens: Inhabited mostly by beasts and man-pigs. Lots of food can be found there.
- Weald: Inhabited by corrupted nature and bandits. Blight can be applied often here.
- Courtyard (Crimson Court DLC): Exclusive to Crimson Court DLC. Courtyard is the only location with quests of epic length. All of those epic quests are about slaying a Boss. Light meter in here does not drop and is always at Bloodlight level providing more stress taken and less bleed resistance. Courtyard is highly inhabited by bloodsuckers.
## Week 4:
- Cove: Inhabited by sea monsters. Most of it's curio applies buffs and debuffs or manipulate quirks.
