Bootable ISO that runs docker - still hunting

# debian
testing now

# gentoo
success - was about to build docker from source (jeez), but this took a long time

# Manjaro
awesome - bit strange, maybe good?
architect - install only, couldn't boot a desktop
i3 - really liked it, but no docker
xfce - wifi didn't work out of the box

# Mint
xfce - was fine
