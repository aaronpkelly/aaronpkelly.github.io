ALSA should already be pre-installed, use that - not pulseaudio.

MPlayer will use the default libavcodec to play mp3 files - which is fine. It
will complain however that it can't find the mpg123 codec files to play.
Install the packages libmpg123-0 (and maybe mpg123?) and then edit the 
~/.mplayer/config file to include:
```
afm=mp3lib
```

The pi can either output audio via the hdmi cable or the standard analogue 
audio jack. Use the below command to switch between hdmi/analogue:

Substituting <n> for the desired mode: 0=auto, 1=headphones, 2=hdmi. For example, to force the Raspberry Pi to use the analog output:
```
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
```
