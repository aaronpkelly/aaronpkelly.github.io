i searched for python and vim, and found a website that suggeted a lot of great
packages for vim, using VUNDLE

there is a bit of a struggle to get YouCompleteMe running on pi, it requires
that vim and cmake be compiled from source, as the binary packages available from
the current raspbian repos are outdated, and it also needs to be built with
python 2.7 support!!! 

use the YouCompleteMe guide to compiling vim with python support, they have one 
written for you
