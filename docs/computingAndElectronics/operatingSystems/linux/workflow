# linux workflow
# all persistent files are saved using git
all my dotfiles are saved on git. whenever I have a fresh installation,
I clone my dotfiles and use a makefile to symlink my environment.
i make an effort to just use the defaults for many program,s rather than
having a billion custom dotfiles, but sometimes this is unavoidable.

i have forked jessfraz's dotfiles, and am adding to that.

# terminals
## use a hard terminal (ctrl+alt+F*)
Try to get away from using a terminal emulator within a graphical session.
Instead, use a hard terminal (ctrl+alt+f1...)

## tty environment: every terminal must start with midnight commander(mc)
every hard terminal you have should be started with midnight commander
running. this is for *easy access* to the filesystem, and with the knowledge
that a shell can be entered by using a key combination `ctrl+0` by default.

## tmux tmux tmux
where possible, run tmux inside of every shell. so this means:
`mc -> ctrl+0 -> tmux`

a busy and very powerful shell environment!

### keep logically similar actions inside a tmux window
start a new tmux window for each logically different operation.
if you need extra windows to help you with your operation, split the tmux
pane into windows - don't create a new window.

## additional ttys
try to use their numbers to logically sort them, local sessions using low
numbers, remote sessions using high numbers:

	tty1: mc + tmux
	tty2:
	tty3:
	tty4:
	tty5: music (mocp)
	tty6: remote sessions(ssh/scp/ftp)

# workflow for windowed environments
## use i3
just do it

## group things logically in workspaces
use a workspace-based organisational method to group logical activities:
	workspace1: spacemacs
	workspace2: gui applications
	workspace3: tabbed termials
	workspace4: internet browser

## tab your terminals (if you're not able to use a hard terminal)
`CTRL SHIFT T` creates a new tab in your terminal window. use this for
logically organising terminal activities into groups.

starting a lot of shell scripts from the terminal? have these one one
tailing a lot of logfiles? have these on another
