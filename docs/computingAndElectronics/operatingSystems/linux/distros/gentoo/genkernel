# specify the .config file!
specify the `.config` file you wish to use when using genkernel, otherwise it will go off and potentially use it's own config (and move your /usr/src/linux/.config file to a .bak)

DO give a full path for the config file
DONT have the .config located at `/usr/src/linux/.config`. genkernel doesn't like that.
have it in a different location, or renamed to a different file (see below):

`genkernel --kernel-config=/usr/src/linux/.config_dellXPS13-9360 all`

# genkernel does it all
#
the command `genkernel all`
- builds kernel + modules + firmware
- creates ramdisk
- modifies grub to use ramdisk

it's amazeballs. don't forget to specific the kernel config file!!!! see the other section
