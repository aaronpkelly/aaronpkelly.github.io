# you need to install wpa_supplicant
if you're connecting to an access point that requires WEP/WPA/WPA2
authentication, then you need to use wpa_supplicant.

you're also going to need two files configured on your local machine in order
for it to connect

## /etc/conf.d/net
replace `wlp0s29u1u4` with the name of your wifi device

```
modules_wlp0s29u1u4="wpa_supplicant"
wpa_supplicant_wlp0s29u1u4="-Dnl80211,wext"
config_wlp0s29u1u4="dhcp"
```

## /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
add the following to this file. the additional options at the top may be needed:

```
ap_scan=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0

network={
	ssid="UPC195407"
	psk="[your password]"
	priority=5
}
```
# wifi services not starting
use `rc-status` to determine if all services have started after logon.
`netmount` and your NIC `net.wlp*` may show as disabled if wpa_supplicant
wasn't able to authenticate. just restart the `netmount` service and they
should both reinitialise
