# run in read-only mode first
when running a command such as:

```
fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

the output of the check may state that it is `unable to set superblock flags`

the solution is to run `fsck` in read-only mode first

```
fsck.ext4 -n /dev/sda1
```

i think this allows fsck to skip superblock problems and find out that there are bad blocks later on in the file system (which cause the superblock flag problems)
