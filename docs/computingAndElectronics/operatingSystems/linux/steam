# installation/first time running problems
first off: run steam from a terminal so you can see the output messages.

## nouveau problems
if you get the message `libGL error: unable to load driver: nouveau_dri.so`,
then run this command:

	LD_PRELOAD='/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6' DISPLAY=:0 steam

explanation is [http://askubuntu.com/questions/635851/error-in-installing-steam-on-ubuntu-15-04](here)

## clearing out gunk
- delete the .steam folder. don't worry, all the main steam resources are in
the .local/share/Steam folder

# nvida drivers
- if you must, try installing the nvidia proprietary drivers. steam won't
usually want to run without good video drivers.

install the proprietary nvidia ones from http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
