# running the boinc daemon
start the init script `/etc/init.d/boinc start`

# monitoring work with boinccmd
this command line tool should preferably be the only way to control the boinc
client. it's very powerful

# configuration of computing preferences
if there is no `cc_config.xml` file, default preferences are used.

a handy file to make changes to is `global_prefs_override.xml`.  if you have
made changes in `global_prefs_override.xml`, you should instruct boinccmd to
us them:

`boinccmd --read_global_prefs_override`

or if you're using the gui client:

`Advanced -> Read local prefs file`

to go back to normal preferences:

`boinccmd --read_cc_config`

# connecting to boinc with a gui client
select `ALT->File->Select Computer` and then enter `localhost` in the text
field. the passord is set in a file `gui_rpc_auth.cfg`. it's easiest to just
have nothing in this file so you don't need to use a password

# configuration files
are in `/var/lib/boinc`. they control all aspects of computing

one of the main configuration files that controls the amount of CPU used for
tasks is global_prefs_override.xml

these lines are of interest:

```
<cpu_usage_limit>50.000000</cpu_usage_limit>
<max_ncpus_pct>100.000000</max_ncpus_pct>
```
