# voltage causing dd problems
dd'ing an image to a sdcard on one machine my fail (the image doesn't boot up
successfully), but may succeed when writing it from another device - like a
laptop.

i saw a post saying this could be due to the higher voltages being used to
drive the card reader, which can cause corruption in writes

anyway, i verified this by writing to an sdcard on a desktop machine, failed,
then tried with the same card reader on a laptop... success
