# general WIFI guide (non distro specific)
# make sure the network device can be detected
`ifconfig -a` should show the wifi device.

if not, check what device is in the system using `lspci -k` or `lsusb`.
make sure the kernel is built containng these drivers (as modules is fine)

#install wpa_supplicant
each distro (gentoo, raspbian, ubuntu) has a diffirent DEFAULT wpa_supplicant
configuration. if wpa_cli (next section) cannot connect to the AP, you may
have to edit the `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` file directly

# install dhcpcd
needed to request an IP from the AP

# use wpa_cli to configure, connect and save WIFI configuration
easiest way to get started.

use wpa_cli to scan and connect to an access point. go read a wpa_cli article on the commands to use.
don't forget to use "save_config" at the end, this will add the network to your wpa_supplicant.conf file.
you can then take a look at the file and see what it added.

wpa_cli is verbose about any connection issues it has, so you can use this
to debug your wifi connection issues too.

## manually testing connecting with wpa_supplicant
you can test that that the configuration for wpa_supplicant is working by
running it in the foreground using this command (via the man page):

```
sudo wpa_supplicant -iwlp58s0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -d
```

if that connects, then run it again in the background:

```
sudo wpa_supplicant -iwlp58s0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
```
# set wpa_supplicant to run at startup
look up how to add the wpa_supplicant daemon to start at runtime for your distro

# driver issues
From the arch linux wpa_supplicant wiki:
> On some (especially old) hardware, wpa_supplicant may fail with the following error:
> Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant
> nl80211: Driver does not support authentication/association or connect commands
> wlan0: Failed to initialize driver interface
>
> This indicates that the standard nl80211 driver does not support the given hardware. The deprecated wext driver might still support the device:
> $wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -D wext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/example.conf
