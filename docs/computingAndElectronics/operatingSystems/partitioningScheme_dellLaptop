## partitioning of disk
Please include these partitions for sharing amongst all distros:
/boot: a boot partition, especially used for holding non-persistent .isos
/home		A separate home partition
/swap		Swap partition - 8g (or double your RAM)

use a large partition for file storage. pretend that everything will burn
tomorrow and don't keep anything persistent. sync everything with git.
