# get the installer running on linux
follow this guide *more or less* and it will work easily:
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20753657354

notes:
- i downloaded the general battle.net client myself, not the one in the article
- i couldn't log in at the first login screen, so i just 'continued without login'. once inside the app, i could login properly

run in 32-bit mode, it will crash in 64-bit
if you can't get the game to run in 32-bit mode, rename the 32-bit exec
file to the 64-bit one. the game will run it!

make sure the WTF/Config.wtf file contains
SET gxApi "D3D9"
