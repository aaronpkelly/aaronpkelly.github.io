All installed games are stored under the default folder:
/home/aaron/.steam/steam/SteamApps/


If you have previously downloaded game data, you can put it in this folder:
/home/aaron/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/


Steam will not auto-detect the game files when you start the client, but it _will_ detect the game files when you try to the install the game from the library
