why i use command line

i don't like distractions
	gets out of the way
	lets me work
	graphics get in the way
		i disable images and javascript
		graphics and sparkles are out

i like having full control
	don't give me a simplistic GUI, give me the docs and i'll read them
	linux command line and suite of GNU tools very powerful
	easy to script and automate

i don't like repeating myself
	anything i find myself doing more than once i want to automate

i can write my own tools
	i can already get so much done with bash, awk and sed
		i can enchance this with command line versions of java, python ruby

i can search for tools on github
	so many projects on github that do so many things

editing is easier
	config files
	writing code
