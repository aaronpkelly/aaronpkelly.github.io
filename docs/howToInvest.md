# High-level financial goals
- Max out your pension contributions
- Pay rent, invest the rest
- Your salary earning potential is unlimited. Look for higher salaries
- Have 6 months of living expenses in liquid cash (savings accounts, rotating CD
ladder, money-market funds, etc.).
- Put any money that you'll need in the next 5 years in low-risk, non-volatile
investments (eg. bonds, T-bills). This usually applies to retirees, but also to
folks like entrepreneurs or commission salespeople that have unsteady incomes.
- Put the rest into broad-based stock index funds. Buy-and-hold forever. Ignore
the volatility of the market. The market is a glass of beer, and volatility is
the froth on top. Focus on the beer.
- Only invest in real-estate, individual stocks, crypto, precious metals,
foreign currencies, collectibles, etc. if you know what you're doing. If it's
not your full-time job (eg. a venture capitalist or real estate developer), no
more than 10% of your net worth in these investments

# Quotes
Warren Buffet:
- If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die
- Stocks have always tended to take an escalator up and an elevator down

Aaron Kelly:
- you will never know your tolerance to risk until you come face-to-face with a bear

Unknown:
- the cobbler has the worst shoes
- Mighty oaks from little acorns grow


# Keep in mind
- Stock markets deliver superior long-term returns but volatility is the “price
of admission”; if you don’t pay the price, you don’t get the returns
- Time in the market, not timing the market, is what builds wealth





# How i organise my personal accounts
## EBS MoneyManager account - current account
EBS MoneyManager account for receiving salary. My Irish employer uses payroll
software that only supports Irish banks, so unfortunately I have to have this.
On the plus side, this account is "free-fees".
I also use this account for some direct debits (broadband, gas+electric).

## Online-only banks
### Revolut
The app is great for budgeting and goal based saving. Any remaining funds from
my current account goes in here. Every months, money is automatically
partitioned into "vaults", a reseved spaces where funds can only be spent on
whatever the vault was created for.

Here are my current vaults:
- utilities (gas/electric)
- reserve tank
- clothing
- luxury item #1
- luxury item #2
- loan_creditCard
- travel_overseas
- games
- transport
- loan_college
- loan_friend
- phone credit
- food and alcohol
- cleaning
- mojo
- meal

# N26
Online-only bank. No charges.














# Bank accounts
Get an account that charges no fees. Use a comparison website to find them.
In Ireland there is the EBS MoneyManager account.
Also, if you get a Revolut card, you essentially have a UK bank account.

## A note on traditional banks
Banks started off simply as a service offering to protect our money.
In return for placing  our money with a bank, they would provide interest to
the depositor.
The money that was on deposit would be used to provide loans to businesses,
ventures etc, making the bank an investor, and generating wealth for themselves.
For a time, things were good.

Nowadays, in a cruel twist, we are now PAYING banks to provide this service,
and think that is normal. It is not.










# Savings
Having a reserve of easily-accessible cash is important. These funds act as a
buffer to unexpected events in life, and allow you the freedom to pivot and take
decisions without the need to worry about the next paycheck.

Unexpected events in life occur. A savings account with readily-available funds
will prevent you from taking on debt in times of need.

Circumstances can change. Your employment status could be unreliable, or you may
decide that a job opportunity is too good to miss. In these times, you will have
a reserve of cash to smooth out any transition periods.

##  Add to your savings account (also called mojo, reserve tank) regularly
Set up an account specifically for holding savings.
This account should do nothing else but provide a safe haven for your savings.
Make sure the account is free from fees, as these will eat into your savings.

The goal is to save one months expenses, including rent, food, travel etc.

Transfer a percentage of your pay into this account until you reach your goal.
5-10% of your pay is a good start.

Over time, increase the amount of savings to cover a longer period of time, e.g.
3 months. Any longer is probably not necessary, the money could be better off
being invested.

## Earning Interest on savings? AER is your friend
You may be able to find a savings account that:
- doesn't charge fees
- doesn't penalise you for withdrawing money when you need it (after all, this
is what your savings account is for)
- is able to provide you with interest on savings, despite withdrawls

If you find a savings account that meets all that criteria, then why not earn
interest on it.
The figure you should be looking for when comparing savings accounts is AER, or
"Annual equivalent rate". It is "annualised interest" - the interest rate
calculated for your investment over the entire year.

## Research tools
### Fund research
https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/ (untested)
http://morningstar.co.uk/

#### Morningstar-optimised advice
Let’s start with Morningstar. If you’re not familiar, Morningstar is an
investment research company that aims to provide normal investors with the
information that financial professionals have.

One great service it provides is a search function for pretty much any stock,
fund or ETF.
The quote that you see isn’t necessarily the most important thing to look at,
as you should be interested in investing for the long term. One-day price
fluctuations, then, don’t really matter to you. But as you can see, it also
breaks down expenses and investment style/category right there on the main page.

The pages you’ll want to pay attention to are Performance, Portfolio, Expense
and Purchase.
Performance shows you, well, how the fund has fared historically
(remember you’re interested in long-term success, though past performance does
not guarantee future results).
Portfolio breaks down what the fund is made up of, including companies,
industries, sectors, the stock/bond mix, etc. If you’re trying to invest in a
broad market index fund, it should have dozens to hundreds of different
holdings. (Think about it: The S&P 500, which your fund may be trying to track
for example, is made up of 500 different companies.)
Expense details the expense ratio, and indicates how the price compares to other
funds. You want to look for large cap funds with expense ratios below one
percent, and small cap/international funds with expense rations under 1.25
percent. Other types of fees are also included on the page, which you can read
about here. Passively managed funds will have lower expense ratios than
actively managed funds, and (likely) perform better as well. “Vanguard 500
Index (symbol VFINX), which mirrors Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, has
outpaced 80 percent of all actively managed large-company, U.S.-oriented
stock funds over the past three years,” writes Kiplinger. It has an expense
ratio of 0.14 percent, and you can find other broad or total-market funds
from the likes of Vanguard and Fidelity with fees lower than that (if your
employer offers them to you, that is).

Finally, Purchase tells you if there are any qualifications for purchasing
shares, like minimum investments. You might also consider Morningstar’s
rating, though I’d look at the other categories first.

All of the pages offer good advice, but those are the four I’d emphasize.

### How to buy and sell
Market order: will get you the deal done immediately (you may have to suffer a
slightly worse price then if you place a limit order).
Strongly advise not to market order, always set a limit order.

Limit order: you set a maximum price you are willing to pay. The order won't be
filled until another seller drops to that price.

Day order: only lasts for the day - if it doesn't get filled it's cancelled.

GTC: good till cancelled. The order lasts forever.

Stop loss: Sell shares if your current position falls decreases and reaches a
certian value.
"if I am buying a share @ say $2.70 and want to minimise losses - what type of order do I input. Say if the price is falling and I want to set it to sell @ $2.60"
To minimise losses: use Sell Option; Order Type : Stop Loss and enter price [$2.60].

Limit order: Sell shares if your current position increases and reaches a value.
"Also when selling if a share is at $3.00 and I want to take a profit at a minimum of $2.90 - can I set up an order so that the position I hold will be automatically sold once the share price hits $2.90"
To take profit @ $2.90: use Sell; Order Type : Limit Order & enter price $2.90

## Concepts
### Dollar-cost averaging
Dollar-cost averaging” is a popular way to buy stocks over an extended period
(weeks or months, say). An investor effectively pays the average price over
that period, rather than the price on any given day – and if they're spending
the same amount every time, they naturally purchase more stocks when prices
go down and fewer when prices go up (via finimize)

### Opportunity cost
Every time you spend money on a good, and not invest it, the chance to have
that amount compound over time is lost forever.

### Risk and your tolerence to it
A lot of investment decisions should be based around your personal tolerence
to risk. What level of risk you can tolerate and still get a good nights
sleep? If your savings fund drops 5% overnight, will that cause your concern?
How about 10%?

### Documentation
Always read it.

E.g. the KID/KIID document for your potential investment.
Every ETF or investment product has a KID/KIID document (Key (Investor)
Information Document).

Before investing you should read about the fund. Every KID document is layed out
in a standard format, and should show you information like the fund risk etc.### Direct investing
Not enough xp to talk about this yet. Barefoot guy recommends investing directly
in about 10 good companies though.


## Cash
## Money market funds
Short-term investment vehicles that provide clients with a liquid alternative to cash





## Investment trusts
Investment Trusts are slightly different. They are 'closed ended' which means the fund is made up of a finite number of shares whose price isn't directly linked with the fund's overall investment; you can potentially buy overpriced or underpriced shares.
This also has implications for the question of Income vs. Accumulation. With a limited number of shares available, they may not offer the facility to automatically reinvest your profit. As such you will need to proactively buy back into the fund if you're in it for accumulation.
Investment Trusts must not retain more than 15% of the total revenue, before expenses, that they generate, meaning that they are required to distribute most, but not all, of their earnings as dividends to their shareholders. The retained earnings can be held in reserve to smooth income distributions in lean years, ensuring a greater cons.

Investment trusts (ITs) are closed-ended investment companies (in the sense that
they have a fixed number of shares in issue) that hold securities or other
investable assets and their shares are traded on stock exchanges in much the
same way as ETFs. However, because there are a fixed number of shares in issue
they will typically trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value (NAV)
of their underlying holdings. ITs will commonly hold income reserves and can
borrow funds to smooth out distributions to investors (unlike ETF shares which
simply fluctuate in value in line with the NAV of the underlying fund assets).

Would suggest it might be worth looking at some UK Investment Trusts due to the more favourable tax treatment if it is going to be a long term investment (33% CGT at sale rather than 41% exit tax with 8y deemed disposal, no offsetting losses). There are a lot to choose from with different flavours of investments. They cost a bit more than an ETF but they can also provide more protection in a bad market depending on what they are investing in.

Straight equity exposure could be something like scottish mortgage trust or foreign and colonial.

Long term capital growth and preservation would generally put you with Personal asset trust, RIT Capital (Rothschild) or Caledonia (Cayzer). There's something reassuring about your money being in the same pot as the poshos but ETFs are very good, especially if you can get US domiciled. One thing to note is that if brexit hits hard it shouldn't do too much damage if you have picked a globally diversified trust as most assets will be earning money outside the UK.

list below, with charges and performance :-
http://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/cefscreener/results.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&Universe=CEEXG%24XLON&CurrencyId=GBP&URLKey=t92wz0sj7c&Site=UKs

select the risk level you can tolerate (e.g. low, -avg, avg) and your minimum acceptable return (e.g. 5% on 5y and 10y). You can also filter out funds with high fees
http://tools.morningstar.co.uk/uk/cefscreener/default.aspx?LanguageId=en-GB&Universe=CEEXG$XLON&CurrencyId=GBP&Site=UK

## Beware: Higher annual management fees
While IT's are a great option to consider, they do charge higher fees that ETFs:
F&C: GB0003466074 - TER 0.54%
SM: GB00BLDYK618 - TER 0.44%

## Foreign and Colonial (good alternative to ETFs for an Irish investor?)
Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust plc,  a widely diversified investment trust.
holds a globally diversified equity
portfolio, has a reasonable TER and is subject to the normal income tax/CGT
regime.
Long term savings.

Don't worry about the fact that their shares are purchased with sterling.
Your currency exposure relates to the underlying securities - not the currency
in which the trust's shares are denominated.

http://www.fandc.com/documents/foreign-and-colonial-investment-trust-factsheet/
FRCL/GB0003466074

## Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust
I like this, but again - management fees!















## Shares/stocks, and funds
Owning a piece of a business.

As in Irish investor, it only makes sense to invest this way after you are
already debt-free and are maxing out your pension contributions.

### Accumulating and distributing funds
Accumulating: all profits are reinvested back into the fund. Allows compunding
of profits. Reinvested funds are not taxed by the Irish goverment.
This should be your preferred type of fund.

Distributing(income): all profits are paid out. Also known as "income".

### Which exchange?
The same product may be traded on multiple exchange.
Choosing a different exchange exposes you to changes in currency exchange rates,
as a fund may by traded in different currencies on different exchanges,
strengthening or weakening your investment.
I usually choose EURO, and trade on Euronext Amsterdam. This exchange also
has realtime price info on degiro.

### Index funds
An index is a list of companies that all share similar features (industry,
market capitalisation (large cap, medium, small..))

An index fund is a fund that tracks this index, buying shares of every company
in the index.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buR6Wvq8s38

### ETFs (Exchange-traded funds) [ETF]
- typically low cost
- built-in diversification
- passively managed

An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.
It is a listed low cost passively managed index tracker
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.
F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.
If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.### Commission free ETF orders on Degiro

It is an open-ended investment fund, the shares in which are listed and traded
on one or more stock exchanges. Unlike a regular open-ended mutual fund,
only certain investors (essentially large financial institutions) can subscribe
for shares directly from the fund and end-investors acquire their interests on
the secondary market.

ETFs are typically passively managed index funds but there are actively managed ETFs - the distinguishing feature of ETFs, as compared to other fund structures, is the manner in which units can be bought and sold - not their investment policy.

### Compound Interest Calc - UCITS vs US Domiciled ETFs
Have a look at this:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=17RaWZPTqq1_8eBgkfNPhpuS7_t3UcmRA

### UCITS ETFs (Irish investor)
One of the few options available for Ireland, will suffer Revenue's lunatic
rules on deemed disposal, if we want access to liquid, diversified international
equities investments. ridiculously-taxed

A US ETF with an equivalent UCITs ETF (VTI -> VUSD/VUSA) has a slightly higher TER % due to its
complicance with EU legislation.

### Non-UCITS listed ETFs are for the moment out-of-bounds
US ETFs are no longer purchasable in Europe due to MIFID.
Vanguard have confirmed to me they will not be producing KIIDs for US-listed
ETFs

## Commission free ETF orders on Degiro
Degiro offer commission-free trades from the "Free ETF Selection" regardless of
size and direction, as long as:
- it is the first trade of the calendar month.
- it does not lead to a short position

The following trades made in that same instrument during the same calendar month
will also be free as long as:
- the trade is in the same direction (i.e. buy/sell) as the first trade made
that month in that instrument
- the trade is over EUR1000

Here is the original Degiro PDF that lists the free ETFs:
https://www.degiro.ie/data/pdf/ie/commission-free-etfs-list.pdf

You can also get a list of all their free ETFs via their advanced search:
Click the Graph icon -> trackers/etfs -> Filter by Trackers -> Free [ -> Show only popular products ]

Interestingly, Degiro does not seem to include any of the super-low TER ETFs in
their commission-free basket. Shame :)

### Finding a great ETF
You should check Degiro for ETFs that meet this criteria:
- UCITs-compliant
- EU domicilied (irish pref!)
- low TER (~0.05%)
- use of profit: accumulating (tax advantages for Irish residents)
- highish volume so there isn't a large spread between bid and ask
- passively managed
- degiro commission-free purchase (ideally via Degiro's free-ETF list)

General advice: A very broad global index fund with fees below 0.2%; it's what
95% of the population should invest in if anything.

Don't get completely concentrated on large caps, thus missing out on most of the
growth that comes from mid caps and small caps.
With such a high concentration of companies reporting in dollars it might become
uncomfortable if say the Chinese decide to reduce their position in US bonds.

### Targeting an index
Do you want to invest in all indexes? There are many.

Look at everything under the "ETF Screener dropdown".
There are a few items.
Each one of these items will help you target an area.

Here is a sample screener search, start choosing regions on the left to sort:
https://www.justetf.com/en/find-etf.html?groupField=none&sortOrder=asc&sortField=ter&distributionPolicy=distributionPolicy-accumulating&assetClass=class-equity

#### Emerging markets
They are very volatile, but lucrative when the stocks are cheap:
https://www.irishtimes.com/business/personal-finance/should-you-buy-when-there-s-blood-in-the-streets-1.3684264

### Diversification
Spread your investments over a number of different sectors and markets!
Losses in one market can be offset by gains in another, smoothing out the ride.

A recent example I had personally was the market "correction" of October 2018:
- a slump in Asian stocks caused US stocks to follow suit, with the Dow Jones
losing 2.4% and the S&P 500 losing 3.1%. This is the first time the S&P has been
in negative territory for 2018
- NASDAQ, a US technology-focussed stock, lost 4.4% - it's worst day since 2011
- this means in one day, this wiped out all my earnings since I started
investing, as my biggest investment is in the S&P 500
- European markets recovered by lunchtime, and the FTSE 100 even gained 0.17%
- The pan-european STOXX 600 fell by 1% initiall, but recovered slightly to only
have a 0.7% loss

This event occurring this early on in my investment career taught me a lot:
- my unshakeable tolerance to risk was truly tested when I saw all my
investments wiped out in a day
- holding on is hard to do
- the average investor is emotional, nervous, speculative, and in moments like
these it's very tempting to become one yourself
- hold on and stay strong
- market volitility is just froth on top of the beer
- being heavily diversified is the way forward


### My investment picks (TODO: update)
In Degiro, I favourite ETFs that I wish to buy in the future.
Below are ETFs that I already own:

#### MSCI USA
The MSCI USA index is an equity index which tracks the return of U.S. stocks.
With its 626 (As of 31/08/18) constituents, the MSCI USA index reflects
approximately 85% of the total market capitalisation in the USA.
ETF investors profit from price gains and dividends of the MSCI USA
constituents. Currently, the MSCI USA index is tracked by 9 ETFs.

#### S&P 500
The S&P 500® is the major US stock market index. It tracks the 500 largest US
companies. The S&P 500 index weights its constituents by free float market
capitalisation.
ETF investors profit from price gains and dividends of the S&P 500 constituents.
Currently, the S&P 500 index is tracked by 14 ETFs.

#### STOXX Europe 600
The STOXX® Europe 600 index tracks the return of the 600 largest stock exchange
listed companies out of 18 European countries. Besides countries from the
Eurozone, like France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy, you also have
exposure to Great Britain, Switzerland and Scandinavian countries.
Due to its broad market exposure, the STOXX Europe 600 index is often quoted as
the European equivalent of the U.S. focused S&P 500 index.
ETF investors profit from price gains and dividends of the STOXX Europe 600
constituents. Currently, the STOXX Europe 600 index is tracked by 3 ETFs.

### A special note about Vanguard
This investment management company is where I eventually want to end up, I
think. So many great funds, a great ethos, and super low TER if I someday
quality for the "Admiral Shares" tier.

Not an investment trust? US-focussed
Unique kind of investment management company. No shareholders to make a profit
for. Have almost zero employees. The share holders own Vanguard.
Rather than paying out profits, it's lowers its fees.

These guys have been around a while!

A nice article on the 10 best Vanguard funds to own:
https://www.thebalance.com/best-vanguard-funds-to-hold-long-term-4154689

##### Vanguard
| IE00B3XXRP09 | Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF | Dist | 0.07 | No | |

VUSA is pretty amazing. It's Vanguard. It's 0.7% TER.
It's not accumulating or commission-free, but it's Vanguard.
Can't go wrong with VUSA over time, IMO.

A note: in the US, you have VTI - Total US Stock Market. UCITs equivalent is VUSD($)/VUSA(EUR), however it
tracks S&P 500 instead of total stock market, and has slighty higher TER 0.07%

VOO - Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF is a compelling option for exposure to U.S. large-cap stocks, but not
available for ireland


#### Other vanguard
VWRL / IE00B3RBWM25 (ftse all-world)

These may not be available:
VTI - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF is a compelling option for exposure to U.S. stocks of all sizes.
VTSAX - Vanguard Total Stock Index Fund. A piece of every publically traded
company in the US

### Other interesting ETFs
#### Gold
Gold is seen as a safe haven by many investors. Especially in financial turmoil, it has shown to stabilise equity/bond portfolios.
An investment in gold is easily done with listed products, like ETFs or ETCs. These investment products track the spot gold price closely, after taking management fees into account. The advantage of exchange-traded Gold products is the minimal bid-ask spread compared to a direct trade in gold bullion. It is mainly due to the large 12.5kg bullion that are held and traded at fund level. Currently, Gold is tracked by 11 ETFs and/or ETCs.
Besides exchange-traded products on Gold in US dollar, there are also currency hedged products in euro, pounds sterling or Swiss francs available. These products are also considered in our comparison.

### More info
I created a script that finds all commission-free accumulating ETFs on Degiro,
sorted by TER. Caution: these free funds might not be great, make sure to look
closely at their 5Y performance, TER etc.

There is also a very interesting site that has lots of good stuff (check out
advanced search and statistics):

https://www.askaboutmoney.com/threads/the-tax-treatment-of-etfs-for-irish-residents.199443/

Some guy made a great visual comparison of an Irish and US domiciled fund, and
the tax due on both (I also made a copy in my drive in-case he gets nuked):

### ETF losses
UCITS ETFs: not offsettable
Non-UCITS ETFs: offsettable + 1270 EUR allowance

### Tax on accumulating ETFs
Dividends will not be taxed if they are reinvested.


### Irish-domiciled ETFs
#### Firstly... taxation on ETFs in ireland
If you opt for an Irish domiciled ETF, such as the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS,
any income on dividends, or gain you might make on the sale of an ETF, will
typically be liable to Dirt, or exit tax, at a rate of 41 per cent.

While the rate of Dirt on deposits is on a downward trajectory (down to 37 per
cent this year from a high of 41 per cent ), the Government has not, as yet,
made a similar move on the tax applying to investments, despite strong lobbying
from the inestment industry to do so.

Tax on gains: Exit tax at 41 per cent
Tax on income: Exit tax at 41 per cent


MIFID is what stopped us from buying US ETFs.


#### More on deemed disposal (https://www.bluewaterfp.ie/investments/which-is-better-gross-roll-up-or-cgt-investments/)
QUESTION: Can I sell everything before deemed disposal cutoff (8 years) and not
have to pay it?

If you invest monthly, just sell everything at once, 8 years after your first
purchase. You don't have to sell every month 8 years after each invidividual
purchse.


Deemed disposal was introduced in 2006 as the Revenue wanted to get their hands
on people’s savings. People were simply saving too much and for too long.
Because dividends and profits were reinvested without any tax liability, the
Revenue weren’t getting any income. So they brought in a rule where you have to
pay tax on funds every 8 years. A way to invest in funds but avoid deemed
disposal, was to invest in US ETF’s, but that has fallen foul of recent European
regulation. People are unhappy with being forced to pay tax on assets they
haven’t realised. But which is better, to have your money grow without any tax
liability but have to pay tax every 8 years and pay it at 41% or pay the lower
rate of CGT at 33% but have to pay tax on dividends? We put it to the test.

#### more stuff about tax
When you cash your fund, the profits are taxed at 41%
Dividends received directly on shares are taxed at your marginal rate of tax which could be as high as 55%
However Capital Gains are taxed at 33% and the first €1,270 is tax-free every year.
When you die, there is no CGT on the gains in your portfolio.


the tax treatment for US and EU domiciled ETFs here in Ireland is quite different.

EU ETFs and mutual funds have "deemed disposal" after 8 years where the government will tax you as if you had sold them and realised the gains. Need to keep track of all the tranches you have bought and when, and losses on one tranche cannot be offset against gains on another. Really way too onerous system - wish the revenue/govt would sort it out.
US ETFs are taxed normally i.e. you buy them and then pay the CGT when you sell them. Only problem is there is a new EU rule this year requiring some additional documentation before they can be sold through a broker here in Europe, like Degiro, which means we can't buy them until they comply with it. No-one seems to know when they will be likely to be available again.

Irish taxes on funds and european domiciled etfs are kind of onerous (there is a very annoying rule about deemed disposal after 8 years) so a lot of people have been buying the US etfs which are simpler to deal with tax-wise. Since 1st Jan however it is impossible to buy US domiciled etfs as they have yet to produce some documentation for new European regulations.

Tax treatment of ETFs. US domiciled seem to make the most sense.
https://www.askaboutmoney.com/threads/the-tax-treatment-of-etfs-for-irish-residents.199443/

UK investment trusts, US ETFs or direct equities should all be subject to "standard" tax treatment

#### more!
accumulating UCITs etf like eg IWDA IWDA is subject to exit tax @41%, with a
deemed disposal every 8 years,

investment trust FRCL is subject to the usual income tax/CGT regime.

U.S./Non EU ETFs MUST distribute dividends by law!! So to maximise capital gains
and minimise income from dividends I have looked towards EU domiciled
accumulating (UCITS) ETFs of which there are hundreds. Many of which are even
denominated in Euros.
Unfortunately the exit tax on these at 41% is greater than their EU ETF
counterparts at 33%.
Here is some information about the websites that can locate them from my other posts....

- I have found a fantastic source for accumulating EU ETF trackers on the German stock exchange in euros, many of which have extremely low TERs
I emailed them to ask how I can locate accumulating ETF's on their website. and got a response back...
you can look up those in our search tool here:
http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/etfs/search
And set the "Use of profits" to accumulating.

- Another fantastic website specifically for ETFs....
If you search for say EURO STOXX 50 for example it will bring up all the ETFS which track this indicie and give ON THE SAME PAGE the, currency, the fund size, the TER, the yearly % up/down and whether it's accumulating or distributing. You can filter for just accumulating ETFs too. Some very usefull info to be all listed on the same page!!!

#### W-8BEN form from Degiro
Logging into Degiro one day, it offered me this:
```
W-8BEN form (substitute)
You can apply for a reduced withholding tax rate on US source income under the double tax treaty between your country of tax residence and the United States of America. Based on the information you provide, DEGIRO will determine your entitlement to treaty benefits.
Certification
I certify that I am the individual that is the beneficial owner of the income within the meaning of the income tax treaty between the United States and my country of tax residence as provided.
The income to which this form relates is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, effectively connected but not subject to tax under an applicable income tax treaty, or the partner’s share of a partnership's effectively connected income.
I acknowledge that the information provided:

    is true, correct, and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
    can be shared with the relevant tax authorities, in accordance with the applicable regulations.

#### Charges - go low
Look for total expense rations or charges of <=0.1 per cent, which is considered
low

# Accumulating or distributing?
If you need a regular income from your investments then an income fund lets you
marry short term benefits of a regular income with some aspects of a longer term
investment (the fund's own shares or unit price).

On the other hand, reinvesting your earnings through an accumulation fund means
your holding will grow faster and with it your potential for profit over time -
assuming the fund performs well.


#### A petition! :)
Petition to Scrap the 41% Exit Tax on Investment Funds and Replace it with Capital Gains Tax

Ireland is one of the leading regulated domiciles for internationally distributed investment funds and exchange traded funds (ETF's). The Irish tax regime has been, and continues to be, one of the key growth drivers of the funds industry in Ireland. The Irish tax treatment of these funds encourages big institutional investors and small individual off-shore investors across the world to use Irish domiciled funds, which, as a result, has seen billions of euro flow into them.
The one group who don't benefit from this is small Irish Investors. The current tax treatment of UCTIS ETF's and other unit linked funds means small Irish investors must pay 41% tax on any gains that they realize from their investments. This compares prohibitively to investing in individual stocks where the capital gains rate of 33% applies.
Furthermore investors in individual stocks can offset losses against gains, while ETF investors can not, leaving them at a significant disadvantage. i.e. if you invest in 2 ETF's and one has loss and one a gain, you must pay tax on the gain and get no benefit from the loss. On top of this ETF investors must pay the 41% tax after 8 years, whether or not they sell their investment, under the again overly-complicated "deemed disposal" rule.
Low cost, broadly diversified exchange traded funds (ETFs) are the best way for ordinary people to get access to and benefit from the stock market. However the current Irish tax treatment completely discourages investment in diversified ETF's and encourages investment in risky single stocks. This can be seen in revenues own figures as the tax take from exit tax is falling (as investors flee these products) while the tax take from Capital gains is rising.
The current, overly-complicated unit exit tax system should be scrapped and replaced with capital gains tax giving a fair, level playing field for all investors.










## Non-divedend paying shares
Invest directly in shares which don’t pay a Dividend. You’ll only pay 33% Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make when you sell those shares. If you invest in a Dividend paying share you could lose more than half of the dividend as you must pay income tax at your higher rate of tax, as well as the USC and PRSI. Higher-rate taxpayers who move their savings into dividend-paying shares in a bid to avoid DIRT may sometimes end up paying more tax on their dividend income than they did on their savings interest.

# Capital gains tax
Every individual has an annual CGT exemption of €1,270 (€2,540 for a couple), this means that the first €1,270 or €2,540 of interest you earn each year is Tax free

# REITs
A REIT real estate investment trust is a company that owns and manages property on behalf of shareholders.

# Equity funds
Medium-long term
fundsmith.co.uk

# Ripoffs?
investment product offered by any Irish life assurance company

# Selling shares - what tax do I pay?
You'll pay PAYE, PRSI and USC on their market value when they are vested and then when you sell them you'll pay CGT on the profit you make between the market value when they vested and when you sold them

## Tax free investments
### Forestry
Returns from investing in forestry are tax free up to €125,000
Locked into the forestry fund for at least 12 years
Returns 5pc to 7pc, net inflation

Be careful about some forestry websites, ppl haven't gotten payments, and some














# Pensions
The power of investing in a pension is TAX RELIEF, and lots of it:
- any contributions to your pension include tax relief
- withdrawing a EUR200,000 lump sum from your pension is tax-free
- withdrawing over EUR200,000 and under EUR500,000 is only taxed at 20% (low!)

## Documentation
Your pension scheme (e.g. Zurich) has great documentation. Read it.


## Goal
Q: Should EUR500,000 be the target fund size for a pension?
A: While it's true that lump-sum withdrawls greater than this amount will be
taxed in the hight 40% bracket, having a smaller fund will mean smaller
monthly payments.

Priorites:
- invest as much as you possibly can in your pension. It's an incredible
investment vehicle
- if your employer matches your contributions, then max your contributions up to
the amount that your employer matches
- additional voluntary contributions: can be made through your employer, but these
contributions will not be matched by them. They will however be affected by tax
relief (again, great)

Invest more money in your pension. You may not like to hear it but it make
sense. All Income and capital gains within a pension fund are completely tax
free, and the compounding effect of tax-free growth over time is very powerful.

## Contributions
- if you pay 20% income tax, you get 20% tax relief on any contributions made
- if you pay 40% income tax, you get 40% tax relief on any contributions made

See:
https://www.zurich.ie/pensions-retirement/calculators/tax-relief-calculator/

## Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs)
Depending on age, you can contribute an extra amount equal to a certain
percentage of your salary.

| Age (attained during tax year) | Total Personal Contribution Limit (as a % of Net Relevant Earnings*) |
| Under 30 | 15% |
| 30 – 39 | 20% |
40 – 49 25%
50 – 54 30%
55 – 59 35%
60 Plus 40%

## Annuities
Can be purchased with their pension fund on retirement and which pay a set
monthly income for life, but die with the annuity-holder.

Annuities have become a very expensive option in recent years, meaning that
people’s pensions savings often do not provide the income anticipated in
retirement. That has led many to opt for an _ARF_ instead.

## Approved Minimum Retirement Fund ("AMRF")
€63,500 of your pension will be locked with limited access until one of the conditions is met:
- reached the age of 75, or
- have a guaranteed income of €12,700 a year, or
- choose to buy an annuity (and recently, annuities aren't doing well at all)

## Approved Retirement Fund ("ARF")
A more flexible pension product, which keeps your pension invested and
available for transfer to family should you die.

## Tax
You pay tax in a lump sum on your pension when you receive it, however:
- up to €200,000 of this is tax-free
- if the lump sum is over €200,000 and under €500,000 (the maximum allowable),
the income tax rate is 20%

Entitled to a tax-free lump sum of 25 per cent of your pension on retirement.
Apparently there is a danger of  paying tax at a rate of 52 per cent on the
fund, but I don't know what will cause this.

Percentage of allowable tax relief on pension savings: 40 per cent.




## Strategy
### Accumulation phase
Contribute to your pension up to the maximum amount that is tax-free and matched
by your employer. It's free money.

Build up your pension pot in separate funds. If you just have one fund, it will
all get retired at the same time. Try to retire on a single fund, work
3-days a week with the 25% tax-free sum from this fund, and keep the other
funds going.

If you’re self-employed for example, you can avail of different pension structures, such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) etc,

If you’re employed, but have worked in various places and thus have built
up several occupational schemes, leave these alone in retirement bonds.

## Retirement
At retirement, you can take 25% of your pension fund out as a lump sum, up to
EUR200,000. The remaining balance is then used as your pension.
Your pension income will be assessable by tax.

## Self employed
If you’re self-employed, you can still contribute to a pension fund.
However, be careful of charges - there can be annual charges (1%) and charges
on each contribution (5%). Aim to get better than that.

You can also avail of different pension  structures, such as retirement
annuity contracts (RACs) etc.



## PRSA
Personal Retirement Saving Accounts (PRSAs) are flexible, portable,
low-cost, transparent pensions. Anyone can take out a PRSA regardless
of employment status. You and your employer, if any, can make tax-free
contributions to it, you can take it with you if you change your job or
employment status, and you can stop and start making contributions at
any time

# REITs
No idea just yet


















































# living frugally / budgeting
Being able to budget, save, and make sensible purchases are an entirely
different set of skills that have a direct impact on how much money you have to
invest.

Enough money to eat, pay utilities, and place value on paying for experiences
and personal development, rather than material possesions.
















# Renting vs owning
Instead of getting a mortgage and paying upkeep and all the related taxes and
costs incurred with owning a home, I have chosen to rent and invest the rest.

# reading material
To read
Definitely do the reading yourself rather than paying money for others to teach you. The books I would consider reading are;

Reminisces of a Stock Operator
Market Wizards
The New Market Wizards
Random Walk Down Wall St.
Alexander Elder's "Trading for a Living" is also worth a read, particularly if you trade using technical analysis.

The last book heavily argues against frequent trading and theorises that buy and hold leads to greater investments. None the less it has good ideas in it and can at least point out some of the pitfalls other investors have.

To summarise key points from the 3 books.
"Sit tight and be right" - Reminisces of a Stock Operator
- If you have a winner and it is indeed still going your way then don't be content with just taking your winnings, stay with it. It is all too easy for emotions to get the better of you and for you to just take your quick profit.

"Losers Average Losers" - Market Wizards
- You will often come across people who if they are long of a position and it goes against them will increase their position even more, thus averaging out their loss or they might still see it as a bargain. In a lot of instances (majority in my opinion) its just throw good money after bad. What you will see less of is when their position is in their favour people increasing their position. As such I agree with their statement that losers average losers and winners average winners. Also despite what some people say, there is no such thing as a paper loss.

Just remember though, I think it is only 1 in 5 of people involved with Spread Betting actually make a profit. From talking to my friend that works in IG Index it seems even less. As far as I understand, the reason its not taxed is because so many people lose they could use their losses as tax deductables and there would be lost revenue to the exchequer.

# Glossary
## Fund
A fund is a source of money that is allocated for a specific purpose
## RSU
Restricted stock unit. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are issued to an employee
through a vesting plan and distribution schedule after achieving required
performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular
length of time. RSUs give an employee interest in company stock but have no
tangible value until vesting is complete. The restricted stock units are
assigned a fair market value when they vest. Upon vesting, they are considered
income, and a portion of the shares are withheld to pay income taxes.
The employee receives the remaining shares and can sell them at their
discretion.

## TER
Total expense ratio.

## UCITs
The Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities
(UCITS) is a regulatory framework of the European Commission that creates a
harmonized regime throughout Europe for the management and sale of mutual funds.
UCITS funds can be registered in Europe and sold to investors worldwide using
unified regulatory and investor protection requirements. UCITS fund providers
who meet the standards are exempt from national regulation in individual
European countries.
