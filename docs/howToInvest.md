# To start.. read a good book
There's some reading suggestions in the section below that offers great,
unbiased financial advice basics. You should read one of them.


# Investopedia is your friend
This website has a glossary of financial terms, and they are all very well
explained. You should keep it open as you learn.
The link to the website is in the website section.

# How i organise my accounts
## Current account
EBS MoneyManager account for receiving salary and paying mandatory direct debits
(rent, utilities)

## Revolut
The app is great for budgeting and goal based saving. Any remaining funds from
my current account goes in here. Every months, money is automatically
partitioned into "vaults", a reseved spaces where funds can only be spent on
whatever the vault was created for.

Here are my current vaults:
- utilities (gas/electric)
- reserve tank
- clothing
- luxury item #1
- luxury item #2
- loan_creditCard
- travel_overseas
- games
- transport
- loan_college
- loan_friend
- phone credit
- food and alcohol
- cleaning
- mojo
- meal



# A note on Banks
Banks started off simply as a service offering to protect our money.
In return for placing  our money with a bank, they would provide interest to
the depositor.
The money that was on deposit would be used to provide loans to businesses,
ventures etc, making the bank an investor, and generating wealth for themselves.
For a time, things were good.

Nowadays, in a cruel twist, we are now PAYING banks to provide this service,
and think that is normal. It is not.












# Bank accounts
Get an account that charges no fees. In Ireland there is the EBS MoneyManager
account.
Also, if you get a Revolut card, you essentially have a UK bank account.










# Savings
Having a reserve of easily-accessible cash is important. These funds act as a
buffer to unexpected events in life, and allow you the freedom to pivot and take
decisions without the need to worry about the next paycheck.

Unexpected events in life occur. A savings account with readily-available funds
will prevent you from taking on debt in times of need.

Circumstances can change. Your employment status could be unreliable, or you may
decide that a job opportunity is too good to miss. In these times, you will have
a reserve of cash to smooth out any transition periods.

##  Add to your savings account (also called mojo, reserve tank) regularly
Set up an account specifically for holding savings.
This account should do nothing else but provide a safe haven for your savings. 
Make sure the account is free from fees, as these will eat into your savings.

The goal is to save one months expenses, including rent, food, travel etc.

Transfer a percentage of your pay into this account until you reach your goal.
5-10% of your pay is a good start.

Over time, increase the amount of savings to cover a longer period of time, e.g.
3 months. Any longer is probably not necessary, the money could be better off
being invested.

## Earning Interest on savings? AER is your friend
You may be able to find a savings account that:
- doesn't charge fees
- doesn't penalise you for withdrawing money when you need it (after all, this
is what your savings account is for)
- is able to provide you with interest on savings, despite withdrawls
 
If you find a savings account that meets all that criteria, then why not earn
interest on it.
The figure you should be looking for when comparing savings accounts is AER, or
"Annual equivalent rate". It is "annualised interest" - the interest rate
calculated for your investment over the entire year. 












# Investing
Make your money work for you. The market is the most powerful wealth-building
tool of all time.

### How to buy and sell
Market order: will get you the deal done immediately (you may have to suffer a slightly worse price then if you place a limit order)
Limit order: you set a maximum price you are willing to pay. The order won't be filled until another seller drops to that price.
Day order: only lasts for the day - if it doesn't get filled it's cancelled.
GTC: good till cancelled
Strongly advise not to market order, always set a limit.

"if I am buying a share @ say $2.70 and want to minimise losses - what type of order do I input. Say if the price is falling and I want to set it to sell @ $2.60"
To minimise losses: use Sell Option; Order Type : Stop Loss and enter price [$2.60].

"Also when selling if a share is at $3.00 and I want to take a profit at a minimum of $2.90 - can I set up an order so that the position I hold will be automatically sold once the share price hits $2.90"
To take profit @ $2.90: use Sell; Order Type : Limit Order & enter price $2.90



## Concepts
### Opportunity cost
Every time you spend money on a good, and not invest it, the chance to have
that amount compound over time is lost forever.

### Risk and your tolerence to it
A lot of investment decisions should be based around your personal tolerence
to risk. What level of risk you can tolerate and still get a good nights
sleep? If your savings fund drops 5% overnight, will that cause your concern?
How about 10%?

### Documentation
Always read it.

E.g. the KID/KIID document for your potential investment.
Every ETF or investment product has a KID/KIID document (Key (Investor)
Information Document).

Before investing you should read about the fund. Every KID document is layed out
in a standard format, and should show you information like the fund risk etc.### Direct investing

in about 10 good companies though.

## Shares/stocks, and funds
Owning a piece of a business.

### Accumulating and distributing funds
Accumulating: all profits are reinvested back into the fund. Allows compunding
of profits. Reinvested funds are not taxed by the Irish goverment.
This should be your preferred type of fund.

Distributing(income): all profits are paid out. Also known as "income".


### Which exchange?
The same product may be traded on multiple exchange.
Choosing a different exchange exposes you to the strength of their currency (Sterling/EURO..)
I usually choose Euronext Amsterdam

### Notable investment management funds
Investment Trusts are slightly different. They are 'closed ended' which means the fund is made up of a finite number of shares whose price isn't directly linked with the fund's overall investment; you can potentially buy overpriced or underpriced shares.
This also has implications for the question of Income vs. Accumulation. With a limited number of shares available, they may not offer the facility to automatically reinvest your profit. As such you will need to proactively buy back into the fund if you're in it for accumulation.
Investment Trusts must not retain more than 15% of the total revenue, before expenses, that they generate, meaning that they are required to distribute most, but not all, of their earnings as dividends to their shareholders. The retained earnings can be held in reserve to smooth income distributions in lean years, ensuring a greater cons.

Investment trusts (ITs) are closed-ended investment companies (in the sense that
they have a fixed number of shares in issue) that hold securities or other
investable assets and their shares are traded on stock exchanges in much the
same way as ETFs. However, because there are a fixed number of shares in issue
they will typically trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value (NAV)
of their underlying holdings. ITs will commonly hold income reserves and can
borrow funds to smooth out distributions to investors (unlike ETF shares which
simply fluctuate in value in line with the NAV of the underlying fund assets).

Would suggest it might be worth looking at some UK Investment Trusts due to the more favourable tax treatment if it is going to be a long term investment (33% CGT at sale rather than 41% exit tax with 8y deemed disposal, no offsetting losses). There are a lot to choose from with different flavours of investments. They cost a bit more than an ETF but they can also provide more protection in a bad market depending on what they are investing in.

Straight equity exposure could be something like scottish mortgage trust or foreign and colonial.

Long term capital growth and preservation would generally put you with Personal asset trust, RIT Capital (Rothschild) or Caledonia (Cayzer). There's something reassuring about your money being in the same pot as the poshos but ETFs are very good, especially if you can get US domiciled. One thing to note is that if brexit hits hard it shouldn't do too much damage if you have picked a globally diversified trust as most assets will be earning money outside the UK.

### Index funds
An index is a list of companies that all share similar features (industry,
market capitalisation (large cap, medium, small..))

An index fund is a fund that tracks this index, buying shares of every company
in the index.

### ETFs (Exchange-traded funds) [ETF]
An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.
It is a listed low cost passively managed index tracker
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.
F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.
If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.### Commission free ETF orders on Degiro

It is an open-ended investment fund, the shares in which are listed and traded
on one or more stock exchanges. Unlike a regular open-ended mutual fund,
only certain investors (essentially large financial institutions) can subscribe
for shares directly from the fund and end-investors acquire their interests on
the secondary market.

ETFs are typically passively managed index funds but there are actively managed ETFs - the distinguishing feature of ETFs, as compared to other fund structures, is the manner in which units can be bought and sold - not their investment policy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVktl8lXxW8

## Commission free ETF orders on Degiro
Degiro offer commission-free trades from the "Free ETF Selection" regardless of
size and direction, as long as:
- it is the first trade of the calendar month.
- it does not lead to a short position

The following trades made in that same instrument during the same calendar month
will also be free as long as:
- the trade is in the same direction (i.e. buy/sell) as the first trade made
that month in that instrument 
- the trade is over EUR1000

Here is the original Degiro PDF that lists the free ETFs:
https://www.degiro.ie/data/pdf/ie/commission-free-etfs-list.pdf

You can also get a list of all their free ETFs via their advanced search:
Click the Graph icon -> trackers/etfs -> Filter by Trackers -> Free [ -> Show only popular products ]

Interestingly, Degiro does not seem to include any of the super-low TER ETFs in
their commission-free basket. Shame :)

### Finding a great ETF
You should check Degiro for ETFs that meet this criteria:
- irish-domiciled (easier)
- commission-free (ideally via Degiro's free-ETF list)
- low TER (~0.05%)
- use of profit: accumulating (tax advantages for Irish residents)

I created a script that finds all accumulating ETFs sorted by TER, go find it.

There is also a very interesting site that has lots of good stuff (check out
advanced search and statistics):
https://www.etfinfo.com/en/statistics/

Use this advanced search on justETF to easily see what ETFs are distributing
or accumulating, ordered by TER (also consider adding more filters like

some other guy:
VUSA as my growth fund with VX5E and VHYL as my dividend funds. Can't go wrong with VUSA over time, IMO.
response:
How exactly is VUSA a growth fund? It is simply a large caps index tracker... and with such a high concentration of companies reporting in dollars it might become uncomfortable if say the Chinese decide to reduce their position in US bonds. 
You seem to be completely concentrated on large caps, thus missing out on most of the growth that comes from mid caps and small caps.


#### Which ones to choose?
General advice: A very broad global index fund with fees below 0.2%; it's what
95% of the population should invest in if anything.

### Non-UCITS listed ETFs are for the moment out-of-bounds
US ETFs are no longer purchasable in Europe due to MIFID.

Vanguard have confirmed to me they will not be producing KIIDs for US-listed
ETFs, which means that

### UCITS ETFs (Irish investor)
One of the few options available for Ireland, will suffer Revenue's lunatic
rules on deemed disposal, if we want access to liquid, diversified international
equities investments. ridiculously-taxed

A US ETF with an equivalent UCITs ETF (VTI -> VUSD/VUSA) has a slightly higher TER % due to its
complicance with EU legislation.










# Tax

the tax due on both (I also made a copy in my drive in-case he gets nuked):
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TgG5Oj_cq7dL8BJoeX8IMiAdk9XPYer5

### ETF losses
UCITS ETFs: not offsettable
Non-UCITS ETFs: offsettable + 1270 EUR allowance

### Tax on accumulating ETFs
Dividends will not be taxed if they are reinvested.


### Irish-domiciled ETFs
#### Firstly... taxation on ETFs in ireland
If you opt for an Irish domiciled ETF, such as the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS,
any income on dividends, or gain you might make on the sale of an ETF, will
typically be liable to Dirt, or exit tax, at a rate of 41 per cent.

While the rate of Dirt on deposits is on a downward trajectory (down to 37 per
cent this year from a high of 41 per cent ), the Government has not, as yet,
made a similar move on the tax applying to investments, despite strong lobbying
from the inestment industry to do so.

Tax on gains: Exit tax at 41 per cent
Tax on income: Exit tax at 41 per cent


MIFID is what stopped us from buying US ETFs.


#### More on deemed disposal (https://www.bluewaterfp.ie/investments/which-is-better-gross-roll-up-or-cgt-investments/)
If you invest monthly, just sell everything at once, 8 years after your first
purchase. You don't have to sell every month 8 years after each invidividual
purchse.


Deemed disposal was introduced in 2006 as the Revenue wanted to get their hands
on people’s savings. People were simply saving too much and for too long.
Because dividends and profits were reinvested without any tax liability, the
Revenue weren’t getting any income. So they brought in a rule where you have to
pay tax on funds every 8 years. A way to invest in funds but avoid deemed
disposal, was to invest in US ETF’s, but that has fallen foul of recent European
regulation. People are unhappy with being forced to pay tax on assets they
haven’t realised. But which is better, to have your money grow without any tax
liability but have to pay tax every 8 years and pay it at 41% or pay the lower
rate of CGT at 33% but have to pay tax on dividends? We put it to the test.

#### more stuff about tax
When you cash your fund, the profits are taxed at 41% 
Dividends received directly on shares are taxed at your marginal rate of tax which could be as high as 55%
However Capital Gains are taxed at 33% and the first €1,270 is tax-free every year. 
When you die, there is no CGT on the gains in your portfolio.


the tax treatment for US and EU domiciled ETFs here in Ireland is quite different.

EU ETFs and mutual funds have "deemed disposal" after 8 years where the government will tax you as if you had sold them and realised the gains. Need to keep track of all the tranches you have bought and when, and losses on one tranche cannot be offset against gains on another. Really way too onerous system - wish the revenue/govt would sort it out.
US ETFs are taxed normally i.e. you buy them and then pay the CGT when you sell them. Only problem is there is a new EU rule this year requiring some additional documentation before they can be sold through a broker here in Europe, like Degiro, which means we can't buy them until they comply with it. No-one seems to know when they will be likely to be available again.

Irish taxes on funds and european domiciled etfs are kind of onerous (there is a very annoying rule about deemed disposal after 8 years) so a lot of people have been buying the US etfs which are simpler to deal with tax-wise. Since 1st Jan however it is impossible to buy US domiciled etfs as they have yet to produce some documentation for new European regulations.

Tax treatment of ETFs. US domiciled seem to make the most sense.
https://www.askaboutmoney.com/threads/the-tax-treatment-of-etfs-for-irish-residents.199443/

UK investment trusts, US ETFs or direct equities should all be subject to "standard" tax treatment

#### more!
accumulating UCITs etf like eg IWDA IWDA is subject to exit tax @41%, with a 
deemed disposal every 8 years,

investment trust FRCL is subject to the usual income tax/CGT regime.

U.S./Non EU ETFs MUST distribute dividends by law!! So to maximise capital gains
and minimise income from dividends I have looked towards EU domiciled
accumulating (UCITS) ETFs of which there are hundreds. Many of which are even
denominated in Euros.
Unfortunately the exit tax on these at 41% is greater than their EU ETF
counterparts at 33%. 
Here is some information about the websites that can locate them from my other posts....

- I have found a fantastic source for accumulating EU ETF trackers on the German stock exchange in euros, many of which have extremely low TERs
I emailed them to ask how I can locate accumulating ETF's on their website. and got a response back...
you can look up those in our search tool here:
http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/etfs/search
And set the "Use of profits" to accumulating.

- Another fantastic website specifically for ETFs....
If you search for say EURO STOXX 50 for example it will bring up all the ETFS which track this indicie and give ON THE SAME PAGE the, currency, the fund size, the TER, the yearly % up/down and whether it's accumulating or distributing. You can filter for just accumulating ETFs too. Some very usefull info to be all listed on the same page!!!

#### Charges - go low
Look for total expense rations or charges of <=0.1 per cent, which is considered
low

# Accumulating or distributing?
If you need a regular income from your investments then an income fund lets you
marry short term benefits of a regular income with some aspects of a longer term
investment (the fund's own shares or unit price).

On the other hand, reinvesting your earnings through an accumulation fund means
your holding will grow faster and with it your potential for profit over time -
assuming the fund performs well.


#### A petition! :)
Petition to Scrap the 41% Exit Tax on Investment Funds and Replace it with Capital Gains Tax

Ireland is one of the leading regulated domiciles for internationally distributed investment funds and exchange traded funds (ETF's). The Irish tax regime has been, and continues to be, one of the key growth drivers of the funds industry in Ireland. The Irish tax treatment of these funds encourages big institutional investors and small individual off-shore investors across the world to use Irish domiciled funds, which, as a result, has seen billions of euro flow into them.
The one group who don't benefit from this is small Irish Investors. The current tax treatment of UCTIS ETF's and other unit linked funds means small Irish investors must pay 41% tax on any gains that they realize from their investments. This compares prohibitively to investing in individual stocks where the capital gains rate of 33% applies.
Furthermore investors in individual stocks can offset losses against gains, while ETF investors can not, leaving them at a significant disadvantage. i.e. if you invest in 2 ETF's and one has loss and one a gain, you must pay tax on the gain and get no benefit from the loss. On top of this ETF investors must pay the 41% tax after 8 years, whether or not they sell their investment, under the again overly-complicated "deemed disposal" rule.
Low cost, broadly diversified exchange traded funds (ETFs) are the best way for ordinary people to get access to and benefit from the stock market. However the current Irish tax treatment completely discourages investment in diversified ETF's and encourages investment in risky single stocks. This can be seen in revenues own figures as the tax take from exit tax is falling (as investors flee these products) while the tax take from Capital gains is rising.
The current, overly-complicated unit exit tax system should be scrapped and replaced with capital gains tax giving a fair, level playing field for all investors.










## Non-divedend paying shares
Invest directly in shares which don’t pay a Dividend. You’ll only pay 33% Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make when you sell those shares. If you invest in a Dividend paying share you could lose more than half of the dividend as you must pay income tax at your higher rate of tax, as well as the USC and PRSI. Higher-rate taxpayers who move their savings into dividend-paying shares in a bid to avoid DIRT may sometimes end up paying more tax on their dividend income than they did on their savings interest.

# Pensions
The power of investing in pension is tax relief, and lots of it.

Invest more money in your pension. You may not like to hear it but it make
sense. All Income and capital gains within a pension fund are completely tax
free, and the compounding effect of tax-free growth over time is very powerful.

In Addition, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you also get 40% tax relief on
any contributions paid into a pension, subject to certain limits. It’s a
no-brainer really.


## ARF
Annualised retirement fund, don't know much about these

## Tax
Entitled to a tax-free lump sum of 25 per cent of your pension on retirement.
Apparently there is a danger of  paying tax at a rate of 52 per cent on the
fund, but I don't know what will cause this.

Percentage of allowable tax relief on pension savings: 40 per cent.

## Strategy
### Accumulation phase
Contribute to your pension up to the maximum amount that is tax-free and matched
by your employer. It's free money.

Build up your pension pot in separate funds. If you just have one fund, it will
all get retired at the same time. Try to retire on a single fund, work
3-days a week with the 25% tax-free sum from this fund, and keep the other
funds going.

If you’re self-employed for example, you can avail of different pension structures, such as retirement annuity contracts (RACs) etc,

If you’re employed, but have worked in various places and thus have built
up several occupational schemes, leave these alone in retirement bonds.

## Retirement
At retirement, you can take 25% of your pension fund out as a lump sum, up to
EUR200,000. The remaining balance is then used as your pension.
Your pension income will be assessable by tax.

## Self employed
If you’re self-employed, you can still contribute to a pension fund.
However, be careful of charges - there can be annual charges (1%) and charges
on each contribution (5%). Aim to get better than that.

You can also avail of different pension  structures, such as retirement
annuity contracts (RACs) etc.



## PRSA
Personal Retirement Saving Accounts (PRSAs) are flexible, portable,
low-cost, transparent pensions. Anyone can take out a PRSA regardless
of employment status. You and your employer, if any, can make tax-free
contributions to it, you can take it with you if you change your job or
employment status, and you can stop and start making contributions at
any time

# living frugally / budgeting
Being able to budget, save, and make sensible purchases are an entirely
different set of skills that have a direct impact on how much money you have to
invest.

Enough money to eat, pay utilities, and place value on paying for experiences
and personal development, rather than material possesions.
















# Renting vs owning
Instead of getting a mortgage and paying upkeep and all the related taxes and
costs incurred with owning a home, I have chosen to rent and invest the rest.















# reading material
To read
Definitely do the reading yourself rather than paying money for others to teach you. The books I would consider reading are;

Reminisces of a Stock Operator
Market Wizards
The New Market Wizards
Random Walk Down Wall St.
Alexander Elder's "Trading for a Living" is also worth a read, particularly if you trade using technical analysis.

The last book heavily argues against frequent trading and theorises that buy and hold leads to greater investments. None the less it has good ideas in it and can at least point out some of the pitfalls other investors have.

To summarise key points from the 3 books.
"Sit tight and be right" - Reminisces of a Stock Operator
- If you have a winner and it is indeed still going your way then don't be content with just taking your winnings, stay with it. It is all too easy for emotions to get the better of you and for you to just take your quick profit.

"Losers Average Losers" - Market Wizards
- You will often come across people who if they are long of a position and it goes against them will increase their position even more, thus averaging out their loss or they might still see it as a bargain. In a lot of instances (majority in my opinion) its just throw good money after bad. What you will see less of is when their position is in their favour people increasing their position. As such I agree with their statement that losers average losers and winners average winners. Also despite what some people say, there is no such thing as a paper loss.

Just remember though, I think it is only 1 in 5 of people involved with Spread Betting actually make a profit. From talking to my friend that works in IG Index it seems even less. As far as I understand, the reason its not taxed is because so many people lose they could use their losses as tax deductables and there would be lost revenue to the exchequer.

# Glossary
## Fund
A fund is a source of money that is allocated for a specific purpose
## RSU
Restricted stock unit. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are issued to an employee
through a vesting plan and distribution schedule after achieving required
performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular
length of time. RSUs give an employee interest in company stock but have no
tangible value until vesting is complete. The restricted stock units are
assigned a fair market value when they vest. Upon vesting, they are considered
income, and a portion of the shares are withheld to pay income taxes.
The employee receives the remaining shares and can sell them at their
discretion.

## TER
Total expense ratio.

## UCITs
The Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities
(UCITS) is a regulatory framework of the European Commission that creates a
harmonized regime throughout Europe for the management and sale of mutual funds.
UCITS funds can be registered in Europe and sold to investors worldwide using
unified regulatory and investor protection requirements. UCITS fund providers
who meet the standards are exempt from national regulation in individual
European countries.
