# Grow stalks from a cutting in a water jar
For all cuttings, remove all lower leaves, seeds, flowers,
and make sure the stem is not woody - it needs to be green.
Once the cutting has developed good roots, replant into a
pot (or a hydro system?)

Always
Basil
Mint
Rosemary
Oregano - cut stem base at 45 degree angle to increase water uptake
Sage
Thyme
