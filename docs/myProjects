[Playlist Generator](https://www.github.com/aaronpkelly/playlistGenerator)

I've written a small tool that can generate playlists from a flat file -
*Playlist Generator*!

Previously I used a spreadsheet to keep track of the mp3 streaming URLs that
online radio stations use, and used some functions to generate the appropriate
`.pls` formatted output, but it felt very cumbersome to me.

The tool outputs playlists in the `.pls` from a simple input file, and outputs
in the `.pls` format most commonly used in conjunction with media players such
as VLC.

send some media to an endpoint, put it on the bottom of the stack, and when
reading the endpoint, have it sent back to you from the top of the stack
