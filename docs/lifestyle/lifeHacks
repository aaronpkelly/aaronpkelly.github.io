Tiny changes make big effects (i haven't really written this well.. this is
more like a note)
Put a small amount of effort into something, and watch the effects of it grow
in size once you get the payoff. It could be something as simple as planning
something ahead of time, starting a small project, or even playing a joke on 
someone.
Also called the 80/20 rule, 80% of payoff in your life comes from 20% of your
work. 



Getting things done with "the absent state"
Walk into a room that you know you need to clean/organize. Say to yourself "I
will spend 5 minutes in this room". Then just switch off. Aim to put yourself
in an absent state where you are automatically doing actions, but not really
thinking about what your doing.  In this way, you'll be able to get tasks or
chores done easily.

Fight entropy
The universe descends from an organised to a disorganised state. Try to place
or position things in a way that minimises entropy - such as if you happened to
knock a book off your bedside cabinet, it would just fall into a box.
It stays orgiansed. Fight entropy.
