 I heard him speak to her again, and his voice was deep, the bass notes
travelling through the walls. He was saying something tender.  Her reply was
soft, but it was undeniable that she felt the same way.

 It wasn't my voice, I'd never spoke like that to her. But there was no 
mistaking that it was hers. 

She rounded the corner, startling me. "Having another one of your daydreams,
my dearest?", she said with a wry smile, as she folded a towel between her
hands.
 "Oh, if only it were a dream." I said, embracing her and pulling her close,
thinking only of how many more embraces I had left.
