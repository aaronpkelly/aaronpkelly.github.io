"The IT Helpdesk Hallelujah"

I'm so happy when i close a ticket
I'm delighted when it goes away
I'm ecstatic when a user calls
And then hangs up, it makes my day

I don't like to solve problems
I just like to read the news
Just put it in my name set to pending
And i'll just put it in another queue

Yes, I'll have my coffee hot and piping
Then I'll space out and call Japan for fun
Whats that, the pie is turning red again
But I think I'll just sit here happy on my buns
