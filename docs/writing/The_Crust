The Story

Episode 1 - "Cash in Hand" - After applying as a medical subject in a university trial, four days and a wad of cash later Simon returns home. He is completely oblivious to the fact that he has also experiencing some serious side effects from the trial. He seems to of forgotten basic domestic skills, like what to do when feeling the need to urinate (luckily his housemate is thirsty most of the time, and things always seem to work out nicely) [I like it :D - Aaron], or how to go about cooking an egg.


Peter sits and reads a newspaper in the living room, TV is on in the background.

Peter
*without looking up* What do you say we get a pizza Simon

SIMON
Can't

Peter
You not hungry? Mr Simon Barringer not in the mood for a pizza, that's a first.

SIMON
... Peter I'm out of money

Peter
*looks up from his newspaper* Simon you just came home a few hours ago, that's impossible.

SIMON
No really I don't know where it's all gone

Peter
Did you spend it?

SIMON
... I just bought a couple of things
[Camera cuts to Simon, wearing a huge jumbo cowboy hat and surrounded by crap]

Peter
What's that? *points*

SIMON
Lifetime subscription to GQ magazine

Peter
What are those?

SIMON
Magic beans

Peter
*holds up a jar* And this?

SIMON
... Bee sweat

Peter
... Simon you have just bought a whole load of crap

SIMON
I really shouldn't go shopping while under the influence.
... ... maybe I need to do some more medical trials

Peter
No Simon, no. You know what you need - you need to get a proper job.

[There's dead silence in the room. Eventually a hanging picture falls off the wall for no reason]

Peter
Suuure... crisp white shirt, tie, I'm sure you'd look the part in no time.
Who wouldn't want to hire this fine specimen, huh? *pinches Simon's cheek*
Show them a bit of potential and you could be getting a nice fat 
paycheck just like your successful french roomie

SIMON
*thinking*
Peter you're a waiter right?

Peter
Correct

SIMON
Mexican restaurant

Peter
Absolutment

SIMON
That one Downtown

Peter
Oui oui

SIMON
The one thats closed down last month

Peter
Some slight probleeeeems.... with the rats

SIMON
... I'm not sure I'm getting your definition of successful Peter

Peter
Lets just say I have other avenues of income
Simon
I've never asked where you go at night Peter and I'm going to 
keep it that way

Nicole
*leans around corner*
Hello Simon, it's wonderful to have you back

Simon
Oh why thank you Nicole I really-

Nicole
There's a pile of dishes right where you left them, I've personally made
sure that they were not touched until your return. Also, before you left 
you threw a load of your underwear in with my washing, so I went to
considerable effort sorting them out and making sure nobody moved them from their place
behind a big pile of your crusty shit in the basement. Seeya later I'm going out.
*dissapears back behind corner*

Peter
... god she really is in a good mood today!

Simon
Yeah I didn't think she'd be that glad to see me, I'm genuinely 
surprised



Simon gets a job interview - while on the phone;
INTERVIEWER
So,

SIMON
Yes... yes I am interested. Infact... I'm so interested...
(whispers) I'd almost kill someone for this job. Thats how interested
I am.

INTERVIEWER
Haha, is that so! Well that certainly is-

SIMON
(deadly serious)
Do you need anyone... Do you need
anyone at all.... to go on a permanent vacation?

INTERVIEWER
...No no, thats quite alright. I-

SIMON
Or I could just maybe rough somebody up then?
I'm an expert at not leaving any bruise-

INTERVIEWER
I uh - think that won't be necessary.. Mr Barringer - I was
actually going to say congratulations for passing...
and... and was going to ask you to come in
for a face-to-face on Monday.

SIMON
.. yes.. yes of course.
Thats.. thats great!
(pause)
Look what I said about the killing..

INTERVIEWER
No no, your just obviously.. very enthusiastic.

SIMON
Just a joke - you know! (nervous high pitched laughter)
I do like to.. say.. my jokes.
...
Monday is fine.

INTERVIEWER
Ok well... we'll see you then!

SIMON
Ok yeah. Thats great - thanks.. bye
(hang up the phone quickly)
Fuck I almost fucked it.

STEVE
I think you did alright mate. Bloody impressive.

SIMON
Steve... Steve I said I was prepared to kill someone in order
to get the interview.

STEVE
Show's passion. I'd take a guy who's prepared to indulge in
a little murder over Johnny-morality any day.

SIMON
Well... it's all well and good when you sell refrigerators Steve,
but are you sure they're the qualities they're looking for in
an accounting executive? No. No I don't think so.

STEVE
I don't sell refridgerators Simon - it's "whitegoods". Whitegoods
Simon, please - there's a difference between the common
refridgerator and what I sell.

SIMON
What, yours are stolen and the others aren't?

STEVE
Now now, no need to get lippy Simon, if the customer
is happy, I'm happy. That's how I run my business.

SIMON
Well I'm sold! With those sorts of principles, who could resist?
Never mind the fact that you're trading in black market goods,
you're providing excellent customer service.

STEVE
Now you've got it, my lad - the foundations of my empire.

Episode 2 - "How to Make the Perfect Cheese Toastie" (ehm... yeah well... hehe... I like cheese toasties ^-^) - Simon comes back to the flat after an impulse purchase at his local whitegoods store off a guy called 'Steve' ( i met up with my friend steve last night.. maybe its him..[does he sell whitegoods? this could be good research] (who we will meet later on) - it's a sandwich toaster with extra 'features' - which turn out to be perfectly ordinary functions which Steve has obviously conned Simon into thinking were amazingly great.

Peter attempts to teach Simon about the finer parts of French cuisine while very stoned, ie "Traditionally, Mont Blanc has been the cheese of choice for all the kings of France... back in the 17th century, no French ruler would ever of had a cheese toastie without the perfect fromage du francais". Peter only ends up dropping some marijuana in a cheese toastie while making a spliff, which they decide to cook anyway and give as a gift to someone.

Soon after, Nikki brings home some pathetic pretty-boy from the club down the road, who insults Simon about his CD collection, (simon promptly summons lucifer to destroy the emo faglord) [Oh thats right your name is Simon aswell isn't it. Funny that.], which he terms as 'naff'. Nikki goes around being blonde for a bit - she is a bit daft - aaaand the emo faglord tucks into the spliffed-out toastie. Nikki later comes back telling everyone about the disasterous night she just had.

Episode 3 - "The Visitor" After a hard night of drinking separately, all three flatmates awake the next day to find a new person mysteriously crashed on the couch. Everybody assumes that this person is a friend of one of the other housemates, without ever questioning it. Although things get interesting when it's slowly realised that infact nobody knows this person at all. (great stuff, cos it COULD happen.. im robbing this idea..) Simon's stiletto, Van Dam, sheep aaaand a cushion - Aoife's Challenge

COME ON AARON WRITE THE CHALLLENGE!!!!

Aaron says: "well you know how much i just love your random ejaculations"

Vorophobe says:

Vorophobe says:

aoife says:

Vorophobe says:

Episode 4 - "Une jeune fille"
Peter's French sister comes for a visit. Simon has proclaimed his intentions for seducing her, until he realises that although French, she's been living in a housing estate in Manchester for the past eight years and is a little rough around the edges. Simon gets put off when she starts stealing for (from him! fuck's sake!!!) him. He does come to the realisation however that although she may work her way through 20 Regal and drink all the bloody vino in the house, that she is rather intelligent - and Simon ends up becoming infatuated with her - to the point of making himself seem incredibly ignorant about all manner of subjects just so he can get her attention. He doesn't even mind when she takes over his room and makes him sleep in a tent outside.

According to Peter, 'Zees ees not ze first time she 'as done zees'

Episode 5 - "A Day in the City"
Simon ventures into the big smoke to visit his long lost cousin Bruce and leaves with questions on his sexual orientation. Bruce and Simon used to be great friends growing up together (flashback to a young Simon and Bruce holding hands running down various back alleys) however the two boys stopped speaking to each other after a tragic accident involving Simon's ferret and Bruce's hairdryer. Ten years down the road the two reunited at a family members funeral and made plans that Simon would visit.

(Present Day)
Things were different though, Simon couldn't quite figure out what was wrong but Bruce seemed to have an awful lot of lava lamps throughout the house. On lots of different occasions, Simon would completely miss the fact that Bruce was roaringly gay - he was completely blind to the fact that Bruce could in anyway at all be a fudgepacker. Then one Saturday morning while retrieving the kitchen plunger from under the sink Simon discovered Bruce's floppy blue dildo. (Shocking stuff!!) [Although it does take Simon a couple of minutes of hard thought to come to the conclusion that it was a A) A dildo and B) Belonged to Bruce], and then everything suddenly fell into place. Shocked Simon quickly packed all of his belongings and left the flat to return home.....to this day Simon can't get the image of the giant blue floppy dildo out of his mind.

Episode 6 - "Keeping the Faith"
An old school friend of Simon's, Emuslim, drops by for a couple of days while an Islamic conference is being held nearby. Nikki, tittering uncontrollably, admits to the fact that she finds his appearing and name generally amusing. Emuslim then goes on to explain that his name is actually quite apt because he's 'modern day Muslim living in the 21st century. Thats fucking E-Muslim isn't it!' He has the Koran audiobook on his mp3 player, he videoconferences in to daily prayers with his 3G phone, and carries a portable GPS system pointing him toward mecca at all times.

However Emuslim's perma-connected life takes a toll when his new auto-predictive messaging program completely screws up his messages, making it seem he's about to blow up a convenience store/hold up the zoo (something dramatic I dunno).

Meanwhile, Peter is tinkering with a concept idea - Nicogone?. After a bad night of pulling, he realises his problem might be his excessive cigarette habit. A solution to this is a concentrated pill which, when placed in a drink, completely neutralises the drinkers perception of ashtray-mouth - perfect for slipping into a potential partners vodka and coke. "They'd never known you'd gone for one - with Nicogone?"

Episode 7 - "Bus fares are the real crime"

Simon pretends to be mentally retarded so that he doesn't have to pay the full bus fare on his way home from the pub. Over the years Simon had gotten increasingly bitter toward the price of public transport, back when the Irish pound was around it was a steady 70p now that the euro was in it seemed to increase every couple of months and Simon was really sick of this. Then one night at his local establishment things came to ahead, as usual Simon had a calculator in his pocket, he decided this one evening to calculate the amount of money he had spent in his lifetime on public transport. When the final number was revealed rage filled Simon's heart.

Inspired by various crap movies and south park episodes Simon decided to take matters into his own hands. He was going to pretend to be mentally retarded in order to get a discount on the bus fare. After not washing for a couple of days and generally being an arse to everyone he knew Simon figured he was ready to test out his new abilities. Judging from the dirty looks and stares he was receiving Simon figured he was fooling everyone as he hobbled towards the local bus stop. As the bus pulled up, Simon hopped on and started his speech....

Bus Driver: "That'll be 2 euro"
Simon: "I'm retarded I don't have to pay that"
Bus Driver: "You are not retarded"
Simon: "What are you blind, I'm fucking retarded"
Bus Driver: "I don't know what you are talking about, you are not retarded!!"
Simon: "I don't fucking believe this, look at my clothes..." Simon gestured at his torn jeans and shit smeared shirt which smelled vaguely of urine.

At this stage the bus driver was getting annoyed

Bus Driver: "Man, you look like you haven't showered in fucking days but you aren't fucking retarded, now get the fuck off my bus...."

Simon got off the bus and headed back to his flat. Simon's big plan had failed and he knew who to blame. When he had asked Peter what a retard was, Peter had obviously lied to him (Peter was well pissed when Simon had asked the question, and had described a homeless person instead of someone who was mentally challenged) Simon knew never to trust a foreigner again when it came to his big plans.





(Hmmm... was episode 5 written by Aoife?)
Why yes it was! She wished to make her presence felt - and threaten me with a hobbling if I didn't let her

  Is there a spell check on this thing? -Aoife 10/14/06, 7:47am
Yep, down the bottom right of the screen! 'Check spelling' -Vorophobe 10/16/06, 10:18am
