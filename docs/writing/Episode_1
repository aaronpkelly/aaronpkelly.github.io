Episode 1
"Cash in Hand"


EXT. AN INNER-CITY SUBURB - DAY
FADE IN - The camera tracks back along a sidewalk, showing unkempt front yards, broken fences and discarded chinese take-away containers. Suddenly, SIMON bounds into frame in time with the camera, whistling and walking in a state of bliss, obviously very happy with himself.

SIMON
(Narrating)
Excuse the nauseating enthusiasm, but this is the exact time
when I disembarked from the number 47 bus, took a right onto
Dewberry lane, and realised exactly how easy it was to
earn two thousand pounds without lifting a finger.

Simon, in a moment of altruism, stops briefly to upright a broken mailbox which had fallen over.

SIMON
(Narrating)
The local University had placed an ad in the paper
looking for suitable candidates for a small medical trial they
were running. Suitable meaning not over 50, relatively healthy
with no prior drug addictions, and no criminal record. Figuring I passed on
at least one of their requirements, I determined myself a prime candidate.

Simon passes an old lady raking leaves on her lawn, and stops to converse.

SIMON
Oh hello there Mrs O'Learly, and what a wonderful morning it is!

MRS O'LEARY
Don't get smart with me, you young tearaway! If I catch you
adding ceramic genitals to my garden gnomes again-

SIMON
Well must be off! It has been delightful, TA TA and all that!

Simon resumes his brisk, gleeful stroll down the street.

SIMON
(Narrating)
I'm Simon by the  way, and after adjusting
 for windspeed, drag and humidity,  I estimate
that in 4 minutes 23 seconds, I'll be home - to be
ritualistically patronised by Nikki...

CUT TO - A girls bedroom, with a close up shot of Nikki as she flips through a magazine.

SIMON
(Narrating)
...harassed by an obstinate and opinionated Frenchman, Nicole...

CUT TO - OUTSIDE GAZEBO - Nicole puffs away absently on a gigantic spliff in one hand, while reading an overtly intellectual book in the other

SIMON
(Narrating)
... and, refreshingly, being flirted at occasionally  by a very fine specimen of
Eastern-European womanhood, Tatiana - who lives next door.

CUT TO - Tatiana talking on her mobile while modelling clothes in a floor to ceiling mirror, speaking in an abrasive european language.

SIMON
Hands off boys, she's got a boyfriend who eats iron
girders for breakfast.

CUT TO - Simon jumping a fence - and being startled by the sight of a dog - he runs furiously from it.

SIMON
(Narrating)
But never mind that! There's absolutely no need to worry
when you've got a nice drug-dealer sized wallet, an overdeveloped
impulse-buy mechanism and your wherabouts are completely unknown
by the last three major banks you've been involved with.

Simon jumps over the opposite fence and the house appears on camera, large and gaudy. The dog turns out to be a small, mangy terrier, yapping maniacally.

SIMON
(Narrating)
It's time for a wee homecoming celebration.

ROLL TITLES
"THE CRUST"

INT. INSIDE THE HOUSE
Simon opens the door, a look of triumph on his face.

SIMON
Everybody, I'm -

NIKKI
(walking by nonchalantly)
Simon you owe me thirty pounds.

SIMON
... back. Thirty pounds! What the hot FUCK do I owe
you thirty pounds for!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - PAGODA
Simon bursts through the outside door, almost kicking it off its hinges and wrestling with it as it flies back at him. Eventually, he manages to get through the doorway.
SIMON
Fifteen minutes back and already that woman has made
me want to eat my own head.

NICOLE
(tapping a corpulent spliff)
Welcome back my man, I trust the time went quickly?

SIMON
Well I was in an induced coma for a lot of it. It's funny but I never
thought being in a coma would be so much hard work.
(Nicole offers the ganj, Simon accepts gladly)
Which is quite terrible really because I could of
caught up on quite of a lot of stuff. Books and
everything I've been meaning to read.

NICOLE
(regarding Simon with subtle confusion)
... what books, Simon?

SIMON
(takes a drag from the spliff and holds it in)
Oh you know... (speaking labouredly) The one about
the... out-of-town lawyer and... the rest of it.

NICOLE
Simon if I ever saw you touch a book I think my
heart would stop. Really, truly, I do.
(Simon smirks and reaches for Nicole's book)
UH UH, no you don't you unenlightened asshair!

SIMON
Thats RICH, unenlightened asshair, you mean!

NICOLE
I hope you didn't spend it all on the way back.

SIMON
