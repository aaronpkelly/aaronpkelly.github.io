Another day of wind and rain,
Umbrella's turned inside-out again
Shoes are wet and muddy too
Is the sky meant to be grey or blue?

Oh look it's forecast frost today
Freezing temperatures are here to stay
This weather is making me so sick
So starting now I'm going to dig

Deep underground is where it's at
No chance of hail or thunderclaps
I'm changing our names as fast as I can
You are molewoman, and I am moleman
