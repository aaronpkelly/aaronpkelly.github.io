allow me to quickly fire off a simple request to my service running in the cloud (via sending an email, curling a REST api) to do many things:
- search for an ebook title and download it on my home server, or publish it to an online location and give me a link
- search for a torrent and download it on my home server, or publish it to an online location and give me a link
- return an email full of daily commute/news info (dublinBikes stations, daily temperature.. etc)

# playlist generator
[Playlist Generator](https://www.github.com/aaronpkelly/playlistGenerator)

I've written a small tool that can generate playlists from a flat file -
*Playlist Generator*!

Previously I used a spreadsheet to keep track of the mp3 streaming URLs that
online radio stations use, and used some functions to generate the appropriate
`.pls` formatted output, but it felt very cumbersome to me.

The tool outputs playlists in the `.pls` from a simple input file, and outputs
in the `.pls` format most commonly used in conjunction with media players such
as VLC.
