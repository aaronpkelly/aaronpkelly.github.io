 And it was this thought that Sil let comfort him as he wrapped a blanket around his shivering body. He lay on his side next to a dying fire, the softening embers inviting the night closer and closer in. Over his lightly chattering teeth, he listened to the noises beyond the camp.
The moors were silent tonight, but far from still. It was that peculiar kind of quiet, the kind of quiet that hangs in the air and settles down on you like a weight growing heavier and heavier. The kind of quiet that gave you with the feeling that there could just be something out there that didn't want to be heard. Farmer folk don't come around these parts anymore, Sil thought. Too many stories, too many superstitions, too many tales. Past the moors, nothing grew.
 But someone had to go. Someone had to walk the old goat trail down into the low valley, pass between the twin lakes and step out onto the moors. Someone had to have the heather claw them and the nettles sting them for the three days they walked out there. Someone who could keep their wits when the stillness began to move, and when the silence became deafening.
