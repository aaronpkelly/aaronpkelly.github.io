the story of a man finally escaping from his fantasy world and facing up to his problems

the end is a dialog between two characters, they sit down and one of them is trying to write a letter (to his ex wife?) to atone for something terrible he did, and he's asking for advice on how to do it, the mood is kind of light at first and the other is urging him on and talking him through

but then the conversation shifts and suddenly gains a lot of weight and significance (there is something happening!), and the character in need says something on the lines of 'these aren't my problems anymore, they never were' or something non-cheesy. anyway, the camera cuts back to the other man, and his clothes are completely changed (cheap jeans and tartan shirt compared to the finery he was previously in), it's daylight, and he's sobbing to himself and wiping his eyes, bent over a scrap of paper and a pencil. this is the pinnacle of the story - this sudden realisation that he cannot live in this world any longer, he must say goodbye to his friend in his fantasy world and face reality. the end shot is him taking the paper and walking out the room to -> someone/somewhere significant

so there's a twist

the whole time he's been immersing himself in a fantasy of his own making, and every problem he was having in his life was represented by some earlier event that was in fact a lot richer in his mind than in reality

for example earlier in the stiry an old friend came to visit him, he was a bit of a wild one - and they both had a history of stealing and knocking over houses (or possibly something grander, like stealing luxury cars for some fancy smuggling rung). Anyway it will turn out it is just the fantasy for his drug habit, and how he'd break into cars to steal radio's etc

so every earlier fantasy sequence was a representation of problems he was having in real life, however they were much more glossy than reality. another example of this is him and his mate arriving at a bar looking normal and talking normally (some fluffy dialog making them seem like two nice guys or whatever), and they walk up to the bar and wait for the bartender to serve them, but the bartender completely ignores them - completely averts his eyes - (this is a point where the main character notices things are out of place, something strange and not normal?). But these thoughts are short lived anyway, because the action just proceeds. anyway, the barman suddenly starts talking to the cleaner or something and he starts closing down the bar, completely ignoring the two guys (one guy!) standing waiting for a drink

the main character feels really hurt

so in reality it was probably him being fucking whacked out of his skull dripping saliva into a ashtray

another sequence was him and a girl trying to escape from the guards by some small trick, to go out in a muscle car and enjoy themselves (they were being carefully watched so it's meant to be a touching romantic scene or something?). but reality was different etc etc etc

everything in the story that happened will turn out to be much different in reality - these are revealed subtly and cross over - for instance at the end of the story it will be quite plain what was real/imagined - but even when he is in his fantasy world things will happen that really do not fit - like a problem a character has that he is completely unable to deal with and is at odds with his high-flying life. 

he is examing himself in his bathroom, healthy body - but when he steps on his weight scales he notices his weight is a lot lower than what it should be - he thinks the scales are broken. 

everything is subtle, nothing is spelled out - there is no narration, a lot is left up to the audience to work out that things are not as they seem

for some reason the main character in my mind was jean claude van damme LOL
