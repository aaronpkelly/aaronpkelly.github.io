## Pensions
Invest more money in your pension. You may not like to hear it but it make sense. All Income and capital gains within a pension fund are completely tax free, and the compounding effect of tax-free growth over time is very powerful. In Addition, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you also get 40% tax relief on any contributions paid into a pension, subject to certain limits. It’s a no-brainer really.

## PRSA
Personal Retirement Saving Accounts (PRSAs) are flexible, portable,
low-cost, transparent pensions. Anyone can take out a PRSA regardless
of employment status. You and your employer, if any, can make tax-free
contributions to it, you can take it with you if you change your job or
employment status, and you can stop and start making contributions at
any time

# REITs

# Shares
## Index funds
### Which ones to choose?
General advice: A very broad global index fund with fees below 0.2%; it's what 95% of the population should invest in if anything.

# ETFs
### Commission free ETF orders on Degiro
Check this spreadsheet to make a commission-free order once every month:
https://www.degiro.ie/data/pdf/ie/commission-free-etfs-list.pdf

### My picks
IWDA / IE00B4L5Y983
CSP1 / IE00B5BMR087
VWRL / IE00B3RBWM25
VUSA / IE00B3XXRP09
IE00B5BMR087 (multiple stock exchanges)

### Accumulating
Keep an eye out for Use of Profits: Accumulating. Much better than distributing, as it allows better compound interest.

## taxation in ireland
the tax treatment for US and EU domiciled ETFs here in Ireland is quite different.

EU ETFs and mutual funds have "deemed disposal" after 8 years where the government will tax you as if you had sold them and realised the gains. Need to keep track of all the tranches you have bought and when, and losses on one tranche cannot be offset against gains on another. Really way too onerous system - wish the revenue/govt would sort it out.

US ETFs are taxed normally i.e. you buy them and then pay the CGT when you sell them. Only problem is there is a new EU rule this year requiring some additional documentation before they can be sold through a broker here in Europe, like Degiro, which means we can't buy them until they comply with it. No-one seems to know when they will be likely to be available again.

Irish taxes on funds and european domiciled etfs are kind of onerous (there is a very annoying rule about deemed disposal after 8 years) so a lot of people have been buying the US etfs which are simpler to deal with tax-wise. Since 1st Jan however it is impossible to buy US domiciled etfs as they have yet to produce some documentation for new European regulations.

Tax treatment of ETFs. US domiciled seem to make the most sense.

### My picks
FRCL/GB0003466074

## Non-divedend paying shares
Invest directly in shares which don’t pay a Dividend. You’ll only pay 33% Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make when you sell those shares. If you invest in a Dividend paying share you could lose more than half of the dividend as you must pay income tax at your higher rate of tax, as well as the USC and PRSI. Higher-rate taxpayers who move their savings into dividend-paying shares in a bid to avoid DIRT may sometimes end up paying more tax on their dividend income than they did on their savings interest.


# Capital gains tax
Every individual has an annual CGT exemption of €1,270 (€2,540 for a couple), this means that the first €1,270 or €2,540 of interest you earn each year is Tax free


# Broker
Use `degiro.nl` - very low fees
Strongly advise not to market order, always set a limit.

## stop loss
> if I am buying a share @ say $2.70 and want to minimise losses - what type of order do I input. Say if the price is falling and I want to set it to sell @ $2.60
To minimise losses: use Sell Option; Order Type : Stop Loss and enter price [$2.60].

## Limit order
> Also when selling if a share is at $3.00 and I want to take a profit at a minimum of $2.90 - can I set up an order so that the position I hold will be automatically sold once the share price hits $2.90

To take profit @ $2.90: use Sell; Order Type : Limit Order & enter price $2.90

## degiro terms
Market order: will get you the deal done immediately (you may have to suffer a slightly worse price then if you place a limit order)
Limit order: you set a maximum price you are willing to pay. The order won't be filled until another seller drops to that price.
Day order: only lasts for the day - if it doesn't get filled it's cancelled.
GTC: good till cancelled

# Acronyms
## ETF
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks

ET = "exchange-traded"
An ETF is traded on a major stock exchange—like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

If you've ever traded an individual stock, then buying and selling an ETF will feel familiar because it's traded the same way.

F = "fund"
An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.

If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification and low costs.
## RSU
Restricted stock unit. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are issued to an employee through a vesting plan and distribution schedule after achieving required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. RSUs give an employee interest in company stock but have no tangible value until vesting is complete. The restricted stock units are assigned a fair market value when they vest. Upon vesting, they are considered income, and a portion of the shares are withheld to pay income taxes. The employee receives the remaining shares and can sell them at their discretion.
