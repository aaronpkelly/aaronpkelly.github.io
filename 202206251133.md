Today I try to build [Himitsu](https://himitsustore.org/), a secret storage system created by [Drew Devalut](drewdevault.com), which was recently announced in one of his [blog posts](https://drewdevault.com/2022/06/20/Himitsu.html)

The package is not on https://search.nixos.org/, so I'm going to try and submit it using [these instructions](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-quick-start)

**UPDATE**: using docker alpine-edge, using the distro's package and building from source failed
