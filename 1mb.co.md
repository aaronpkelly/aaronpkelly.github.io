Free website hosting with a DATABASE: https://1mb.co/

I'm doing a lot of work and documenting things in my git repo: https://git.sr.ht/~aaronkelly/aaronkelly.1mb.co

# Broken?
All I see is this page: ![[1mb.co.png]]

Update: it seems to have been resolved recently

# Bug?
Note - there's currently a bug? with the website (i contacted the developer on twitter).

## solution
When logged in it links you to your site: https://aaronkelly.1mb.co/
But you should actually go to https://aaronkelly.1mb.site/q
