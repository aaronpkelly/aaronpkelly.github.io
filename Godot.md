Stop waiting for Godot!: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28352397

> So, basically: I thought next weekend might be a good time to finally sit down and try to learn Godot. Why don't you join me?

> I'm new to Godot, so I asked people for recommendations for good resources for learning the engine. Here were the most common ones:
> A lot of people strongly recommended the [GDQuest website](https://www.gdquest.com/) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest/videos), which seem great - they're very extensive and detailed, and the youtube channel features a "[get started with godot in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KEcm-iYJ2a8UCRN62bTneKa)" series, which seems like a really great place to start.
> An alternative video series that a number of people recommended is BornCG's "[Let's Build a 2D platformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvPTSZl2WCc)" series, which seems really nicely made and clear!
> If, like me, you prefer written tutorials over videos, Kids Can Code.org has a [Godot 101 tutorial](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/g101/), and a "[recipes](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/)" guide filled with how-to guides on specific Godot problems.  
> It seems like the [official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) is a really great place to look too - it's kept up to date by open source contributors. I had one very strong recommendation the "[Your First Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html)" tutorial.  
> Can't wait for the jam to start! See you this weekend!
