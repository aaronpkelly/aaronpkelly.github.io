> **Five whys** (or **5 whys**) is an [iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration") interrogative [technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill "Skill") used to explore the [cause-and-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") relationships underlying a particular problem.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys#cite_note-1) The primary goal of the technique is to determine the [root cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause "Root cause") of a [defect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/defect "wikt:defect") or problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "five" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.
