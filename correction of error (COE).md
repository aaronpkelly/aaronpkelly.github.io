> # Correction of Error (COE)

> Correction of Error is a process for improving quality by documenting and addressing issues. You will want to define a standardized way to document critical [root causes](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.rca.en.html "Helps in identifying what, how, and why an event or failure happened resulting in corrective and preventive measure."), and ensure they are reviewed and addressed.

> After the incident is where Amazon is great. They wrote a COE (correction of errors report) that detailed why this happened (using [5 whys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) to get to the true "bottom" of each cause), wrote up specific immediate actions, and included lessons learned (like never make direct changes in prod _anywhere_ without a second set of eyes approving your change through the CM process). What you see in this write up is derived from that report. That report is sent out in draft form to nearly the entire company for review and comment. And they do comment. A lot. Questioning things is a cultural habit they have.

> For all that's wrong with Amazon, the best part was when someone fucked up, the team and the company focused only on how we make it never happen again. A human mistake was a collective failure, not an individual one. I really appreciated that in my time there and have learned that it contributes to a condition of effective teams called [psychological safety](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety). Google identified it as one of the main differentiating features between effective and ineffective teams in a research study they did internally years ago.

> Individuals only got torn down if they tried to hide mistakes, not go deep enough in figuring out what went wrong, or not listen to logical feedback about their service. Writing a bad COE was a good way to get eviscerated.

> the most important part of these COEs is the culture behind it.

> Management NEEDS to have a strong engineering background in order to appreciate the origins of COEs.

> Unfortunately there are some teams that will throw COEs at other teams as a means of punishment or blame which kind of undermines the mission of the COE.
