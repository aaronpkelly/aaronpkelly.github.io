"Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines
to execute" - (SICP)

Howdy, I'm Aaron, and I'm really good at breaking things. So much so, I've even made a living out of it! Someitmes if the mood takes me I'll even try putting those things back together, and if I learn something in the process... I'll write a post about it!

# Posts

Posts are the the main focus of my website. My aim for them is to contain insightful, well-curated and to-the-point information about a particular topic. They will also be revised and updated over time.

Some posts will have different flavours and focus. Some will exist simply to  share my narrow experiences on a particular topic, however some may take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have compiled over a long period of time.

Psst... if you want the RSS feed, it's [here](https://aaronpkelly.github.io/feed.xml).
