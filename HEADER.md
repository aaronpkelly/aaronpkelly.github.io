Howdy, I'm Aaron, and I'm really good at breaking things. Occasionally, I learn stuff while doing it!

# What's here? Posts. Lots of them

Posts are the the main focus of my website. If you want the RSS feed, it's [here](https://aaronpkelly.github.io/feed.xml).

I decided a while back that I wanted to have all of my thoughts, efforts and experiments as public-facing as possible. I call it [Blog-driven development] (I don't expect that to catch on).

My aim for them is to contain insightful, well-curated and to-the-point information about a particular topic, revised and updated over time.

That's the goal... but in reality, this blog is basically a brain-dump of every topic I'm interested in, while I frantically try to keep up and organise these thoughts in a presentable way.

So yes, my posts will have different flavours and focus. Some will exist simply to  share my narrow experiences on a particular topic, however some may take the form of larger walkthrough guides that I have compiled over a long period of time.

# OMG runnable code examples

I use embedded code examples in some posts, courtesy of https://repl.it!

If for some reason you cannot see the code inside these embeds, you may be using a browser (e.g. Brave) which is blocking style elements needed to display them. If you would like to see the text properly, you should whitelist my site (in Brave's case, choosing 'Shields Down for this site').
