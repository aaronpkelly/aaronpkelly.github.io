# Incubating posts

Some posts just aren't ready for the limelight yet.

However, if you wish to get a preview of what's coming up, they are available in
my git repo as they're being written: [link](https://github.com/aaronpkelly/aaronpkelly.github.io/tree/master/_posts).

# Not-posts



# Why do this

I decided that writing about my interests is a good way for me to:

- create value from everything I do
- keep the content simple and to the point 
- make it presentable and shareable
- expose everything I do in the public domain. Hopefully, it will be useful to
someone somewhere (I like helping people!), and it will encourage me to keep my
standards up

# Turn that post into a sparkly PDF

PDFs of all my articles will soon be on https://gumroad.com, using "pay what you
want" pricing.

# APIs

I love APIs. I've created some backend APIs for websites that I use heavily, but
who don't offer a public API - frustrating!

Below are some static frontend websites that use my APIs a the backend:

# Other projects that I'd like to monetize someday

I have a bunch of other pet projects that I occasionally work on from time to
time, with a hope to charging a small monthly membership for.

So far things have proven to be hazard free, although really I'm kind of thinking of lots of little cool things and trying to work a storyline around it. Well it goes for 2 minutes anyway, so if I screw it up, eh, no big loss :P I'm gonna try and see if I can get some extra characters happening (friends come over ALL the time, I'm thinking a bit TOO often), so  I'll write a basic script and then take it from there. Yeah. And I'll make sure it's up on this site sometime too.

I saw the  stars through veils of ash, and the sun through stinging eyes... I lived and breathed on belched fumes, where clean air was becoming as precious as clean water. And  all the while, they called it the pinnacle of modern-living. Intro Credits A friend had called me to let me know he was dropping by to pick up some cargo,  down at the docks, and I was to meet him there. He knew about my dream of  escaping from here, even if it was for a few days, I could do with the time off. INT. SpaceCraft B: Hey! What's up chucky? Welcome aboard. C: Good to see you.

How's life on the surface? C: Sucks, as usual. B: Well I hope you've packed, 'cause we're leaving in 10.

Stuff about concerts and hurting people. Access the Scanmachine Rataeva's Domicile Glorious Speldiffy FRiends Recently (last thursday the 6th) Aranmore had it's annual cross country race. 2.5k for the lads, and 2 k for the gals, situated on the  picturesque banks of Lake Monger. Needless to say it was pretty good (aside from the sun, ouch). There was a huge cookup on the BBQ of which I got to get into,  not eating it, but helping out with the onion-sizzling. I came in 11th out of the yr 12 yeargroup, which is fair enough, I think, given that I had to help set up the whole damn thing beforehand, so I didn't run meh personal best. Ok, so I don't have a personal best, but damn was I buggered at the end, specially when that shit Luke beat me by a hair. Grr :P And that was Thursday. No swans were injured during the proceedings. www.runnersworld.com Good site for runners and wannabe runners :P Access the Scanmachine Rataeva's Domicile Glorious Speldiffy FRiends Ahh, weeks lay before me and I haven't even got a clue what to do with them. The way it should be. Hopefully it'll be used for just fun and concerts and stuff. Mind altering substances might make a cameo too, you neeeever know now do you. Oh, and working on flash stuff. Yeah. Cause it's fun and I'm gonna rule with world with it someday. Maybe start up something like the Heaven's Gate cult. God knows someone will believe me in the states, for sure! -->
