# Why do this

I decided that writing about my interests is a good way for me to:

- create value from everything I do
- keep the content simple and to the point 
- make it presentable and shareable
- expose everything I do in the public domain. Hopefully, it will be useful to someone somewhere (I like helping people!), and it will encourage me to keep my standards up

# Turn that post into a sparkly PDF

PDFs of all my articles will soon be on https://gumroad.com, using "pay what you
want" pricing.
