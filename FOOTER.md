"I saw the trailer. It's very well done. We can see that it is industrial cinema, that there is a lot of money, and that it was very expensive. But if it was very expensive, it must pay in proportion. And that is the problem: There are no surprises. The form is identical to what is done everywhere. The lighting, the acting, everything is predictable." - A completely non-technical quote by Jodorowsky talking about watching the Dune trailer
