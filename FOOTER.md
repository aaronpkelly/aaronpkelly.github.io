The above list is pretty unstructured. It might be great in future to:

- organise them by tag/category

- organise them by association (graph links)

# Like a post? Grab a hardcopy

If I've done a good enough job with one of my posts, you may feel like it's worthy to have the breath of life breathed into it, and have it printed out somewhere. I've considered putting PDFs of popular articles on https://gumroad.com (using "pay what you want" pricing). Let me know if this interests you!
