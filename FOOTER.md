# My vision for this site
- try to create value from everything I do. Make it presentable, and share it
- expose as much of my work as I can into the public domain
- use basic markdown for all content, keep it simple, don't get fancy
- use other services to bookmark people and sites I like. For people I admire, link to the people I'm following on twitter. For bookmarks, link to my favourited posts on Hackernews

# Get PDFs of all my articles
