This site is mainly about tracking my progress and adventures in software
development.

Many of the categories at the top of the site are progress trackers for a
number of different domains that I'm interested in.

Once sufficient progress has been made in a domain, something fruitful will
be made to mark my achievement, such as:
- a post detailing what I've learned
- a project (github repo) putting my learned skills into practice
- an update to my CV that I'm now fluent/conversant in that area
